What are the potential ways of killing them? What are those things you are doing right now or have done that resulted in you killing or suffocating your dreams and ambitions? Do you even know what they are? Are they things you do every day and think it is perfectly normal since it is a part of you?\nBel Pesce, in her TEDTalk, talked about 5 ways to kill your dreams.\n\nBelieve in overnight success.You wonder who does that? Oh well, there are people out there who, in this day and age, still feel success can come at the snap of the fingers. You see this very big supermarket, thriving well. It just opened two new branches and you say, “Woooow, it is doing so well!” And you forget that the business has probably been in existence (in one small shop) for the past 10 years, and has passed through thick and thin to get to where it is at present. BUT, your overnight success story is always a result of everything you’ve done in your life through that moment.\n\nBelieve someone else has the answers for you.Have you noticed that people always want to help out, be it family, friends, some colleagues, business partners, lecturers, course mates, etc. they always have one advice or the other on what part you should take. “You walk so erectly and rigidly; you should be a headmistress! You would fit in perfectly, you teach and explain things so well, you should be a teacher or lecturer, after all, you even talk like Dr Akpan!” See? They don’t even ask for your opinion. No one has all the answers for you or your life. Eventually, everything boils down to you making decisions FOR and BY yourself.\n\nDecide to settle when growth is guaranteed.We all get comfortable with things when they are going smoothly. You have hit the N650,000 target for the month, and feel you should relax. Hmm… No wonder most banks increase the targets from time to time, you say? Don’t settle.\n\nBelieve the fault is someone else’sThere is nothing as lazy and pathetic as blaming someone else for your mistakes or for anything happening to you, it is downright irresponsible. Take responsibility for your actions. Bel gave this example, ” ‘Yes, I had this great idea, but no investor had the vision to invest’. You relate with this, right? If you can’t get an investor to invest, there is something there that is your fault. You need to get your dreams and make them happen. And no one achieved their goals alone. But if you didn’t make them happen, it’s your fault and no one else’s. Be responsible for your dreams.”\n\nBelieve that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves.We all have dreams and aspirations, at least most of us. Just like in school, most people were there just for the certificate alone, not the knowledge nor the experiences — social and otherwise, so it is with our goals. When you have achieved them, do you ask yourself, “What next?” Do you remember the process? Did you learn anything (new or about yourself)? Achieving a dream is a momentary sensation, and your life is not. The best way to really achieve all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step of your journey.\n\n\nIf you want to kill your dreams, endeavour to do all this and you would do a fabulous job. Just kidding… Rid yourself of all these attitudes and thoughts and you will be on your way to living a wonderful life.\nWatch the Ted Talk below\n","dateCreated":"2022-10-22T20:49:43+08:00","dateModified":"2022-10-24T21:30:10+08:00","datePublished":"2022-10-22T20:49:43+08:00","description":"","headline":"five ways to kill your dreams","image":[],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://simonteo58.github.io/2022/10/22/TED/five_ways_to_kill_your_dreams/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"kirkzhang","sameAs":["https://github.com/","nil","nil","nil","nil","nil","mailto"],"image":"nil","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"nil"}},"url":"https://simonteo58.github.io/2022/10/22/TED/five_ways_to_kill_your_dreams/"}</script>

<p>《five ways to kill your dreams》–TED</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have dreams, it is your responsibility to make them happen.<br>– Bel Pesce</p>
<p>There are so many articles and posts which tell you about ways to achieve your dreams, but then, which one tells you about how to kill them? What are the potential ways of killing them? What are those things you are doing right now or have done that resulted in you killing or suffocating your dreams and ambitions? Do you even know what they are? Are they things you do every day and think it is perfectly normal since it is a part of you?</p>
<p>Bel Pesce, in her TEDTalk, talked about 5 ways to kill your dreams.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Believe in overnight success.<br>You wonder who does that? Oh well, there are people out there who, in this day and age, still feel success can come at the snap of the fingers. You see this very big supermarket, thriving well. It just opened two new branches and you say, “Woooow, it is doing so well!” And you forget that the business has probably been in existence (in one small shop) for the past 10 years, and has passed through thick and thin to get to where it is at present. BUT, your overnight success story is always a result of everything you’ve done in your life through that moment.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Believe someone else has the answers for you.<br>Have you noticed that people always want to help out, be it family, friends, some colleagues, business partners, lecturers, course mates, etc. they always have one advice or the other on what part you should take. “You walk so erectly and rigidly; you should be a headmistress! You would fit in perfectly, you teach and explain things so well, you should be a teacher or lecturer, after all, you even talk like Dr Akpan!” See? They don’t even ask for your opinion. No one has all the answers for you or your life. Eventually, everything boils down to you making decisions FOR and BY yourself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Decide to settle when growth is guaranteed.<br>We all get comfortable with things when they are going smoothly. You have hit the N650,000 target for the month, and feel you should relax. Hmm… No wonder most banks increase the targets from time to time, you say? Don’t settle.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Believe the fault is someone else’s<br>There is nothing as lazy and pathetic as blaming someone else for your mistakes or for anything happening to you, it is downright irresponsible. Take responsibility for your actions. Bel gave this example, ” ‘Yes, I had this great idea, but no investor had the vision to invest’. You relate with this, right? If you can’t get an investor to invest, there is something there that is your fault. You need to get your dreams and make them happen. And no one achieved their goals alone. But if you didn’t make them happen, it’s your fault and no one else’s. Be responsible for your dreams.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Believe that the only things that matter are the dreams themselves.<br>We all have dreams and aspirations, at least most of us. Just like in school, most people were there just for the certificate alone, not the knowledge nor the experiences — social and otherwise, so it is with our goals. When you have achieved them, do you ask yourself, “What next?” Do you remember the process? Did you learn anything (new or about yourself)? Achieving a dream is a momentary sensation, and your life is not. The best way to really achieve all of your dreams is to fully enjoy every step of your journey.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to kill your dreams, endeavour to do all this and you would do a fabulous job. Just kidding… Rid yourself of all these attitudes and thoughts and you will be on your way to living a wonderful life.</p>
