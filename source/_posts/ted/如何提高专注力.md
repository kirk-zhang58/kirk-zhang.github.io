> 《How to Get Your Brain to Focus-TED》--TED
A few years ago, I began to observe
几年前 我开始意识到
something in my own behavior
我的某些行为
that made me a bit uncomfortable.
让我有点不舒服
And that was that from the moment that I woke up
那就是从我起床的那一刻开始
to the morning then to the end of the day
到一天结束
my life was a series of screens.
我的生活充斥着各种屏幕
I started the day with the thing that woke me up
早晨第一个叫醒我的是我的手机
first thing in the morning – my phone.
我的一天就这么开始了
And so I sat there in bed,
然后我就坐在床上
watching various cooking videos on Instagram
在ins上看各种各样的美食视频
and bouncing around between a bunch of different applications.
在不同的APP之间切换
But then, it was time to get out of bed and cook breakfast.
接着 我该起床做早饭了
And so the thing that I focused then on,
于是我关注的对象
in addition to the omelette in the pan
除了锅里的煎鸡蛋
was the iPad that was right next to the oven.
还有烤箱边上的iPad
And then it was time to do some work.
接下来我该去工作了
And so I went to a different screen,
我又到了另一个设备前
which was attached to another screen itself.
这个设备也自带一个屏幕
All the while this little devil on my wrist was tapping,
与此同时 我手腕上的这个小玩意儿 也一直在滴滴答答地响
and beeping, and blooping, and distracting me
分散着我的注意力
as I was trying to get important stuff done.
让我无法专心完成重要的工作
But there was one particular offender
但是在所有的这些设备中
out of all of these different devices
有一样最烦人
that I wasted more time on than anything else
浪费我时间最多
that was this dastardly thing – my phone.
那就是我的手机
I can spend hours on this thing every single day,
我每天要在上面耗费好几个小时
and so I decided to essentially for all intents and purposes
因此我决定 无论如何
get rid of the thing for a month.
要远离手机一个月
As an experiment, I thought I’m gonna live on this thing
作为试验 我把手机使用时间
for just 30 minutes every single day at a maximum.
设置为每天最多30分钟
And so this is the amount of time I have for maps,
每天就最多用这么多时间来查地图
this is the amout of time to call my mother,
给妈妈打电话
this is the amount of time that I have for everything that I could possibly wanna do.
这就是做所有我需要做的事情的时间
To listen to music, to listen to podcast.
听音乐 听广播
And I obsevered what happened during this time.
然后我观察这段时间发生的事情
It took about a week
我用了一个星期
to adjust downward into a new lower level of stimulation.
才把我的大脑调整到这个低刺激状态
But once I did,
但是我做到了之后
I noticed that three curious things began to happen.
三件神奇的事情发生了
First, my attention span grew.
首先 我的注意力持续时间增加了
It was like I could focus on things
也就是说我能更容易地进入专注状态了
not effortlessly but with much more ease
不说毫不费劲吧 但的确是比
than I could before this experiment started.
试验开始前更容易了
In addition to this though, as I was going about the world
除此之外 当我探索世界时
and especially when my mind wandered a bit,
特别是大脑有点走神的时候
I have more ideas that my mind arrived at.
我脑海里会涌现出更多的想法
And on top of this
而且
I had more plans and thoughts about the future.
我对未来有了更多的规划和思考
Getting rid of one simple device led to these three effects.
远离一个设备 就能带来这三点效果
Why?
为什么呢
Noticing this, a few years back led me on this long journey
从几年前注意到这点开始 我花了很长时间
to get to the bottom of what it takes to focus in a world of distraction.
研究如何才能专注 避免被其他事物分散注意力
I poured over hundreds of research papers
我把成百上千份研究报告铺开
from front to back of my office.
摊满了我的办公室
I don’t know if you’ve ever watched one of those crime shows
不知道大家看没看过刑侦节目
where somebody’s solving a murder
警察在破解谋杀案时
and so they have this big bristled board
他们在一块巨大的 透明板上系着绳子
and their string attached to papers,
贴着纸
attached to memos, attached to newspaper,
备忘录和报纸
but this is like what the state of my office was.
我的办公室就像那个样子
I flew out to meet experts around the world who study focus.
我飞到世界各地 去见研究专注力的专家们
I conducted more experiments on myself and tell the point.
我在自己身上做了更多试验 都指向同一点
I have 25,000 words of research notes about
我记了两万五千字的研究笔记
why this is the case.
来分析原因
How does technology influence our attention and our ability to focus?
科技是如何影响我们的注意力和专注力的
I want to start with the attention spans that we have.
首先我想讲一讲我们的注意力持续时间
This is how we pay attention to the world around us
也就是我们如何关注身边的世界
and how much control we have over our focus.
我们能在多大程度上控制自己的注意力
The research around this particular area is fascinating.
这个领域的研究令人惊叹
It turns out that when we to work in front of a computer
原来 当我们在电脑前工作时
especially when our phone is nearby,
尤其是手机在旁边的时候
we focus on one thing for just 40 seconds
我们专心做一件事的时间只有40秒
before we switch to doing something else.
然后就会被其它东西转移注意力
And when we have things like Slack open as we are doing some work,
而如果我们工作时开着Slack软件
this lowers to 35 seconds.
专注时间则会下降到35秒
But the reason that this is the case is not
但是通过这个研究
what we might think after looking at the research.
我发现原因并不是我们所想的那样
We think the problem is that our brains are distracted.
我们以为是大脑被分散了注意力
But after looking at the research this is what I’ve come to know as a symptom
但在读完研究报告后 我认识到这其实是一种征兆
for the deeper problem which runs much more deeply.
在更深层次的原因之下
It’s the root cause of this distraction.
有一个关键的问题
It’s not that we are distracted. It’s that our brains are over stimulated.
我们的大脑并不是被分散了注意力 而是被过度刺激了
It’s that we crave distraction in the first place.
我们一开始就渴望分心
Our brains love these tiny little nuggets of
我们的大脑喜欢这些小想法
information, and social media, and e-mail,
信息 社交媒体 邮件
and these things that we do over the course of the day.
以及一天里我们所做的所有事情
There is even a mechanism in our mind called the “novelty bias”
我们大脑里甚至还有一种机制叫做“新奇偏见”
by which our mind rewards us with a hit of dopamine,
大脑会释放多巴胺
one of those wonderful pleasure chemicals,
一种令人愉悦的化学物质
the same one that we get when we eat and order a whole medium pizza from Domino’s,
我们在吃一整块中份披萨
that you know the same one that we get when we make love.
或者做爱时大脑也会释放同样的多巴胺
We get that same stimulation when we check Facebook.
我们在刷Facebook时也会得到同样的刺激
We get these dopamine coursing through our mind and so we not only crave distraction
这些多巴胺在我们大脑中流动 所以我们不仅想要分神
but our mind rewards us for seeking out
我们大脑还会因为我们的探索而奖励我们
and finding distraction in the first place.
并且在第一时间找到让我们分神的东西
So this is the state of our minds today.
这是今天我们大脑的状态
We are at these hyper-stimulated state
在这样一个超级刺激状态下
where we bounce around between this bunch of different objects of attention
我们的注意力在不同的对象上不断跳跃
that are very very stimulating for our mind.
这对我们大脑刺激很大
So I thought, OK, if the phone had this impact on my attention span,
那么 鉴于手机对我们的注意力有如此大的影响
what if I lowered how stimulated I was even more still.
如果减少刺激会怎么样呢
And so, you know, this feeling that we experience
想象一下这种感觉
when we go from being in a state of high stimulation to a state of low stimulation,
当我们从高刺激状态进入低刺激状态时
it has a name. That name is called “boredom”.
这个过程有个名字 叫做厌倦
You know this is restlessness that we feel
你知道这会令我们感到焦躁
when we have this super busy week and then we were lying down a couch on a Sunday afternoon
忙碌的工作日过后 在一个阳光明媚的下午 躺在沙发上
and thinking, “What am I doing now?”
然后想：“我接下来要干嘛呢？”
So I challenged to put out a call
于是我鼓起勇气打了一个电话
to the readers on my website and I asked them,
打给我网站的读者 我问他们
“What is the most boring thing that you can think of doing?
“你认为你能想到的最无聊的事是什么
I’m gonna make myself bored for an hour a day for a month.”
我将在一个月里每天都让自己无聊一个小时”
And so I did some stuff that
所以接下来我做了这些事情
I still upset about from my readers to this day.
我到现在都觉得那天我不该问那些读者
Day 1 I read the iTunes terms and conditions for one hour.
第一天我阅读了一个小时iTunes的使用条款
It’s actually shorter and more readable than you might think.
其实这个比你想象中更短 更有意思
Day 4 I waited on hold of with Air Canada’s baggage claims department.
第四天我给加拿大航空公司行李认领部门打了电话
It’s very easy this is a trick. If you wanna make yourself bored
当你想要无聊的时候 去搞一个这样的恶作剧是很简单的
don’t call the reservations department, call the baggage claim people,
注意不要打预订部门电话 要打行李认领部门电话
‘coz you are gonna wait for hours if you ever get through it all.
不然你将会等一个小时 要是你熬得住的话
Day 19 I counted all the zeros that I could
第19天我数了圆周率前一万位中
in the first ten thousand digits of pi.
所有零的个数
Day 24 I watched a clock
第24天我看一个闹钟
“tick…tick…” for one hour.
滴答……滴答……整整一个小时
And 27 other activities this month.
还有我这个月的其他27个活动
‘Geeze.’ I still think that.
现在回想起来都觉得 “哦 天呐”
But curiously, I noticed the exact same effects
但是神奇的是
as I did during the smartphone experiment.
这竟和我当初做手机实验时的效果一样
It took about a week for my mind
我花了一周时间
to adjust downward into a newer lower level of stimulation.
来把我的大脑调整到低刺激状态
And this map curiously on top of research that shows
这个实验很神奇的显示了
that it takes our mind about 8 days to fully calm down and rest,
我们的大脑需要花费大约8天的时间才能平静下来
like when we are on a vacation as an example.
就像在度假时一样
Our vacations need to be longer than they are today.
我们的假期应该更长一点
But I also noticed that my attention span expanded.
我也发现我的注意力提高了
I was able to focus even more effortlessly,
我更容易集中注意力了
because I wasn’t surrounded by fewer distractions,
因为我不再被那些能使我分心的事物包围
but my mind was so much less stimulated
我的大脑不再处于高刺激状态
that it did not seek the distraction in the first place.
不再容易突然分神
But the fun part where these ideas and plans that struck me that didn’t before.
有趣的是 我还有了之前没有过的一些想法和计划
And the reason that this is the case is because my mind had a chance
这是因为我的大脑有机会
to wander more often.
去思考更多了
There is a great quote that I love
这里有一句我很喜欢的话
that you might be familiar with from J.R.R Tolkien,
你们可能知道这句话 J.R.R.托尔金说的
where he says that, “Not all those who wander are lost.”
“不是所有踌躇的人都迷失了方向”
And the exact same thing is true.
确实如此
It turns out with regard to our focus with regard to our attention.
这与我们注意力的集中有关
If you think back to when your best most brilliant ideas strike you,
你回想一下 除非你有一个绝妙的想法
you rarely focused on something.
否则你很少在某件事上集中注意力
Maybe this morning you were taking a shower,
可能你在今天早上洗了一个澡
or maybe some morning in the past and
或者可能在过去的某一个早晨
then your mind had a chance to connect several of the constellations of ideas
你的脑海里出现了很多的想法
that were swirling around in your mind to create an idea
它会在你思考的时候打乱你
that would never have materialized otherwise
你将永远无法把这些主意具体化
if you were focused on something else, on your phone, for example.
如果你一直把你的注意力放在其他东西上 比如手机
This is a mode especially when we do this deliberately
尤其在我们故意这样做的时候 这就变成了一种模式
when we deliberately let our mind wander.
我们故意让大脑去漫游
I called this mode “Scatterfocus”.
我将这种模式称为“分散注意力”
And the research shows that it lets our mind come up with ideas.
这个研究显示它能令你的大脑产生想法
It lets our mind plan because of where our mind wanders to.
这也能让我们的大脑按我们所想的进行计划
This is fascinating.
这很吸引人
It turns out that when we just let our attention at rest,
它显示了当我们让自己的注意力放松时
it goes to three main places.
大脑会做三件事
We think about the past.
回忆过去
We think about the present.
考虑现在
And we think about the future.
以及思考未来
But we think about the past less than we might think,
但是我们回忆过去的时间要比我们想象的短
only about 12% of the time.
仅占我们所想时间的12%
And often that time we were recalling ideas
回忆过去通常只是
in these thoughts wandering episodes.
一个小插曲
But the present, which is a much more productive place to wander.
因为现在更值得去思考
We wandered to think about the present 28% of the time,
我们用28%的时间来思考现在
and so this is, you know it’s something as simple as you’re typing up an e-mail.
就像你在写邮件时
And you can’t find a way to free something
你找不到办法去放松
because it’s very delicate maybe it’s political.
因为你需要很小心 可能这封邮件是关于政治的
You go and walk to another room,
你走到其他房间
you go to another room of the house, of the office.
你走到家里或办公室里的其他房间
The solution hits you because your mind had a chance to approach it
你突然就有了解决方法 因为你的大脑有机会
and prod at that problem from different directions.
去看到问题的不同方面
But here is the thing.
但有一点
Our minds wandered to think about the future
我们的大脑想要思考更多关于未来的事
more than the past and the present combined.
比关于过去和现在的事加起来还要多
Whenever our mind is wandering we think about the future 48% of the time.
无论什么时候 我们大脑所想的48%是关于未来的
This is why when we were taking a shower we plan out
这就是为什么我们在洗澡的时候
our entire day even though it hasn’t started yet.
会做一整天的计划 尽管这天还没到来
This is called our mind’s “prospective bias”
这叫做“预知偏见”
and it occurs when our mind wanders.
并且在我们神游的时候也会出现
If you are good with math, or maths I should say,
如果你数学很好的话
not in Canada anymore,
当然 在加拿大是不可能的
these numbers don’t add up to 100
这些数字很难加到100
because the rest of time our mind is dull.
由于我们的大脑在某些时间是迟钝的
It’s blank or doesn’t have an idea inside of it that is rooted in time.
所以有时候它会是空白的
But whatever it is for you that lets your mind wander,
但是无论如何 让你的大脑去想
something that is simple,
一些简单的事情
something that doesn’t consume your full attention.
不会消耗你全部注意力的事情
Mine happens to be something that is not necessarily stereotypical
对于我这个年龄和性别来说
of my age, and gender, demographic.
我有一些奇怪的癖好
But I love to knit.
我喜欢织毛线
Knitting is one of my favorite hobbies.
这是我最大的爱好之一
I knit in planes. I knit on trains. I knit in hotel rooms.
我在飞机上 火车上 在宾馆 我都会织
I was knitting in the hotel room before this event today
这几天我在住的宾馆里就有织毛线
‘coz it helps calm you down. It helps settle your nerves.
因为这能让我平静 能减少焦虑
And I come up with so many ideas when I knit.
我的许多想法都是织毛线的时候想到的
I have a notepad next to me.
我会在旁边放一本记事本
But whatever it is for you,
但对你来说可能是别的
might be taking an extra long shower, might be taking a bath,
可能是洗个很久的淋浴 或是泡澡
upgrading your shower to a bath,
将淋浴升级为浴缸
so you can soak not just with your body but with your ideas as well.
你浸透的不仅是身体 还有你的思想
Could be simple if you are at work walking from one room to another in the office.
工作时从一间办公室走到另外一间
Very simple change but if you don’t use your phone during that walk,
虽然很简单 但如果你在走路时不使用手机
your mind will go to the meeting that you are about to attend.
你的头脑将会更专注于即将参加的会议
It’ll go to the call that you are just on.
它会转移到你刚刚接到的那通电话
It’ll wander to the ideas that are circulating.
转移到刚刚盘旋在你脑中的想法
And it’ll make you more creative in this way.
这样你就变得更有创造力了
It could be something as simple as waiting in line,
这就和排队等候一样简单
and just, I don’t know, waiting in line.
就像在排队
It could be getting a massage and whatever it is that lets your mind
可以是做个按摩或者任何能让你大脑放松的事
I love this picture so much [chuckle]
我超喜欢这张图
Whatever you love doing, here is a pro-tip.
无论你喜欢做什么 给你一个提示
Ask the masseuse to let you have a notepad in the session,
在这段时间里叫按摩师给你一个便条
because ideas always come to you and you are always incubating things,
因为想法一直涌向你 并且你会不断产生新想法
and so capture them so you can act upon them later.
抓住它们 这样后面你就能行动起来
But I think after doing this deep dive into the research,
但是在深入研究以后
we need to make two fundamental shifts
我认为我们需要两个基本的转变
with regard to how we think about our intention.
关于如何思考我们的目的
We think that we need to fit more in,
我们认为自己应该更加适应

你知道很多演讲都是关于奋斗的
I’m an anti-hustler.
我是一个反对忙碌的人
I’m one of the laziest people you’ll ever meet,
我是你们见过最懒的人之一
and I think that’s what gives me so many ideas to talk and write about.
我认为这恰好给了我很多想法去说 去写
We don’t need to fit more in.
我们不需要再去适应
We are doing enough. We are doing too much.
我们做的足够了 够多了
We are doing so much that our mind never wanders anymore.

It’s sad. This is when our best ideas and plans come to us.
这很可惜 我们本来可以有更好的想法和计划
We need more space.
我们需要更多空间
If you look at what allows traffic to move down the highway,
看看高速公路 是什么让交通移动
what allows it to move forward isn’t how fast cars are moving as you might expect.
不是你以为的车在以多么快的速度前进
It’s how much spaces exists between the cars
而是车辆之间存在的空间
that allows traffic to move forward.
这才是让交通向前移动的原因
Our work and our life are the same way.
我们的工作和生活也是如此
The second shift.
第二个转变
We like to think of distraction as the enemy of focus.
我们喜欢把三心二意当做全神贯注的敌人
It is not.
不是这样的
It is the symptom of why we find it difficult to focus,
为什么我们很难集中注意力
which is the fact that our mind is over stimulated.
因为我们大脑被过度刺激了
I have a challenge for you.
我给你们一个挑战
It’s a two-week challenge,
一个为期两周的挑战
but it’s a challenge to make your mind a bit less stimulated
这是个能减少对你大脑的刺激
and simply notice what happens to your attention,
并且只关注对你注意力影响的挑战
how many ideas do you get,
你有多少想法
how does your focus change,
你的注意力是如何转变的
how many plans do you make.
你制定了多少计划
So for two weeks, make your mind less stimulated.
所以在两周里 让你的大脑少受刺激
There are so many great features on phones and devices
在手机上和其他设备上有如此多的诱惑
that will let us eliminate a lot of the time we waste on our devices.
这会让我们减少大量浪费在这些设备上的时间
Use those features, not only to become aware of how you spend your time,

在那个专注的时间段里 你会收获很多
If there is one thing that I’ve found to be true
在我探索这个世界 关于我们如何集中注意力之后
after doing this deep dive into this world on how we focus,
如果有一件已经被我证实是正确的事情
it’s that state of our attention is what determines the state of our lives.
那就是我们注意力的状态决定我们的生活状态
If we are distracted in each moment,
如果我们与每个瞬间断开联系
those moments of distraction and over-stimulation build up and accumulate
这些分心和受到过度刺激的瞬间就会累积
to create a life that feels more distracted and overwhelming,
会制造一个更加容易分心并且疲惫的生活
like we don’t have a clear direction.
就像我们失去了明确的方向
But, when we become less stimulated, when we make our mind more calm,
但当我们受到更少的刺激 大脑更加冷静的时候
we get the benefits of added productivity and focus on ideas and creativity,
我们就能够集中想法和创造力 从而得到益处
but we also live a better life because of it.
