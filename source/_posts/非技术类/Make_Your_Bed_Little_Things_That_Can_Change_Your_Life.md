It is daily life that needs this same sense of structure. Nothing can replace the strength and comfort of one’s faith, but sometimes the simple act of making your bed can give you the lift , you need to start your day and provide you the satisfaction to end it right.

If you want to change your life and maybe the world—start off by making your bed!
