To my three children: Bill, John, and Kelly. No father could be prouder of his kids than I am of you. Every moment in my life has been made better because you are in the world.
And to my wife, Georgeann, my best friend, who made all of my dreams possible. Where would I be without you?

## Preface

The ten lessons I learned from Navy SEAL training, which were the basis for my remarks, seemed to have a universal appeal.
在海军海豹突击队训练中，我学到的十条经验教训，成为了我发言的基础，似乎有着普遍的吸引力。

## chapter 1 Start Your Day with a Task Completed
The barracks at basic SEAL training is a nondescript three-story building located on the beach at Coronado, California, just one hundred yards from the Pacific Ocean. There is no air-conditioning in the building, and at night, with the windows open, you can hear the tide roll in and the surf pounding against the sand.

Rooms in the barracks are spartan. In the officers’ room, where I berthed with three other classmates, there were four beds, a closet to hang your uniforms, and nothing else. Those mornings that I stayed in the barracks I would roll out of my Navy “rack” and immediately begin the process of making my bed. It was the first task of the day. A day that I knew would be filled with uniform inspections, long swims, longer runs, obstacle courses, and constant harassment from the SEAL instructors.

“Attention!” shouted the class leader, Lieutenant Junior Grade Dan’l Steward, as the instructor entered the room. Standing at the foot of the bed, I snapped my heels together and stood up straight as a chief petty officer approached my position. The instructor, stern and expressionless, began the inspection by checking the starch in my green uniform hat to ensure the eight-sided “cover” was crisp and correctly blocked. Moving from top to bottom, his eyes looked over every inch of my uniform. Were the creases in the blouse and trousers aligned? Was the brass on the belt shined to a mirrorlike radiance? Were my boots polished bright enough so he could see his fingers in their reflection? Satisfied that I met the high standards expected of a SEAL trainee, he moved to inspect the bed.

The bed was as simple as the room, nothing but a steel frame and a single mattress. A bottom sheet covered the mattress, and over that was a top sheet. A gray wool blanket tucked tightly under the mattress provided warmth from the cool San Diego evenings. A second blanket was expertly folded into a rectangle at the foot of the bed. A single pillow, made by the Lighthouse for the Blind, was centered at the top of the bed and intersected at a ninety-degree angle with the blanket at the bottom. This was the standard. Any deviation from this exacting requirement would be cause for me to “hit the surf” and then roll around on the beach until I was covered head to toe with wet sand—referred to as a “sugar cookie.”

Standing motionless, I could see the instructor out of the corner of my eye. He wearily looked at my bed. Bending over, he checked the hospital corners and then surveyed the blanket and the pillow to ensure they were correctly aligned. Then, reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a quarter and flipped it into the air several times to ensure I knew the final test of the bed was coming. With one final flip the quarter flew high into the air and came down on the mattress with a light bounce. It jumped several inches off the bed, high enough for the instructor to catch it in his hand.

Swinging around to face me, the instructor looked me in the eye and nodded. He never said a word. Making my bed correctly was not going to be an opportunity for praise. It was expected of me. It was my first task of the day, and doing it right was important. It demonstrated my discipline. It showed my attention to detail, and at the end of the day it would be a reminder that I had done something well, something to be proud of, no matter how small the task.

Throughout my life in the Navy, making my bed was the one constant that I could count on every day. As a young SEAL ensign aboard the USS Grayback, a special operation submarine, I was berthed in sick bay, where the beds were stacked four high. The salty old doctor who ran sick bay insisted that I make my rack every morning. He often remarked that if the beds were not made and the room was not clean, how could the sailors expect the best medical care? As I later found out, this sentiment of cleanliness and order applied to every aspect of military life.

Thirty years later, the Twin Towers came down in New York City. The Pentagon was struck, and brave Americans died in an airplane over Pennsylvania.

At the time of the attacks, I was recuperating in my home from a serious parachute accident. A hospital bed had been wheeled into my government quarters, and I spent most of the day lying on my back, trying to recover. I wanted out of that bed more than anything else. Like every SEAL I longed to be with my fellow warriors in the fight.

When I was finally well enough to lift myself unaided from the bed, the first thing I did was pull the sheets up tight, adjust the pillow, and make sure the hospital bed looked presentable to all those who entered my home. It was my way of showing that I had conquered the injury and was moving forward with my life.

Within four weeks of 9/11, I was transferred to the White House, where I spent the next two years in the newly formed Office of Combatting Terrorism. By October 2003, I was in Iraq at our makeshift headquarters on the Baghdad airfield. For the first few months we slept on Army cots. Nevertheless, I would wake every morning, roll up my sleeping bag, place the pillow at the head of the cot, and get ready for the day.

In December 2003, U.S. forces captured Saddam Hussein. He was held in confinement during which time we kept him in a small room. He also slept on an Army cot, but with the luxury of sheets and a blanket. Once a day I would visit Saddam to ensure my soldiers were properly caring for him. I noticed, with some sense of amusement, that Saddam did not make his bed. The covers were always crumpled at the foot of his cot and he rarely seemed inclined to straighten them.

During the ensuing ten years, I had the honor of working with some of the finest men and women this nation has ever produced—from generals to privates, from admirals to seamen recruits, from ambassadors to clerk typists. The Americans who deployed overseas in support of the war effort came willingly, sacrificing much to protect this great nation.

They all understood that life is hard and that sometimes there is little you can do to affect the outcome of your day. In battle soldiers die, families grieve, your days are long and filled with anxious moments. You search for something that can give you solace, that can motivate you to begin your day, that can be a sense of pride in an oftentimes ugly world. But it is not just combat. It is daily life that needs this same sense of structure. Nothing can replace the strength and comfort of one’s faith, but sometimes the simple act of making your bed can give you the lift you need to start your day and provide you the satisfaction to end it right.

If you want to change your life and maybe the world—start off by making your bed!

## chapter 2 You Can’t Go It Alone

I learned early on in SEAL training the value of teamwork, the need to rely on someone else to help you through the difficult tasks. For those of us who were “tadpoles” hoping to become Navy frogmen, a ten-foot rubber raft was used to teach us this vital lesson.

`tabpoles` ['tæd,pol] / n.脊椎 蝌蚪 
`rubber` ['rʌbɚ] / n.橡胶；橡皮
`vital` ['vaɪtl] / adj. 至关重要的；生死攸关的；有活力的

Everywhere we went during the first phase of SEAL training we were required to carry the raft. We placed it on our heads as we ran from the barracks, across the highway, to the chow hall. We carried it in a low-slung position as we ran up and down the Coronado sand dunes. We paddled the boat endlessly from north to south along the coastline and through the pounding surf, seven men, all working together to get the rubber boat to its final destination.
`chow hall`   / 食堂
`dunes` [dʊn] / 沙丘
`low-slung` [] / 腰身
`poundding` ['paʊndɪŋ] / n.重击；重击声

But we learned something else on our journey with the raft. Occasionally, one of the boat crew members was sick or injured, unable to give it 100 percent. I often found myself exhausted from the training day, or down with a cold or the flu. On those days, the other members picked up the slack. They paddled harder. They dug deeper. They gave me their rations for extra strength. And when the time came, later in training, I returned the favor. The small rubber boat made us realize that no man could make it through training alone. No SEAL could make it through combat alone and by extension you needed people in your life to help you through the difficult times.
`crew` [krʊ] / n. 队，组；全体人员，全体船员 vi. 一起工作
`slack` [slæk] / adj. 松弛的；疏忽的；不流畅的 vi. 松懈；减弱 n. 煤末；峡谷
`picked up` [] / 捡起 获得
`ration`  / vt. 配给；定量供应 n. 定量；口粮；配给量
`favor`  / 喜爱和赞成

Never was the need for help more apparent to me than twenty-five years later 
when I commanded all the SEALs on the West Coast.
I was the commodore of Naval Special Warfare Group ONE in Coronado. A Navy captain, I had by now spent the past several decades leading SEALs around the world. I was out for a routine parachute jump when things went terribly wrong.
`captian` 上校

We were in a C-130 Hercules aircraft climbing to twelve thousand feet preparing for the jump. Looking out the back of the aircraft, we could see a beautiful California day. Not a cloud in the sky. The Pacific Ocean was calm, and from this altitude you could see the border of Mexico just a few miles away.
`climbing` [] / v 爬
`calm` [] / adj 平静的

The jumpmaster yelled to “stand by.” Now on the edge of the ramp, I could see straight down to the ground. The jumpmaster looked me in the eye, smiled, and shouted, “Go, go, go!” I dove out of the aircraft, arms fully extended and legs tucked slightly behind my back. The prop blast from the aircraft sent me tilting forward until my arms caught air and I leveled out.
`ramp` [ræmp] / n. 斜坡，坡道；敲诈 vi. 蔓延；狂跳乱撞；
`dove` [] / v潜水式
`prop` [prɑp] / n. 支柱，支撑物；支持者；道具；（橄榄球中的）支柱前锋 vt. 支撑，支持，维持；使倚靠在某物上
`blast` [blæst] / n. 爆炸；冲击波；一阵 vi. 猛攻 vt. 爆炸；损害；使枯萎
`tilting` [tɪlt] / n. 倾卸台adj. [航][气象] 倾斜；倾卸
`level` [] / n. 水平；标准；水平面 adj. 水平的；平坦的；同高的 vi. 瞄准；拉平；变得平坦 vt. 使同等；对准；弄平
`altitude`  [] / n高度

I quickly checked my altimeter, made sure I wasn’t spinning, and then looked around me to ensure no jumper was too close to me. Twenty seconds later I had fallen to the pull altitude of 5,500 feet.
`altimeter` [æl'tɪmətɚ] / n 测高仪
`too to` 这东西要多角度看

Suddenly, I looked below me and another jumper had slid beneath me, intersecting my path to the ground. He pulled his rip cord, and I could see the pilot chute deploying the main parachute from his backpack. Immediately, I thrust my arms to my side, forcing my head to the ground in an attempt to get away from the blossoming chute. It was too late.

The jumper’s chute popped open in front of me like an air bag, hitting me at 120 miles an hour. I bounced off the main canopy and spun out of control, barely conscious from the impact. For seconds I spun head over heels (倒转身体), trying to get stable again. I couldn’t see my altimeter and was unaware of how far I had fallen.
`slid` [slɪd] / v 滑
`rip`  [] / vt. 撕；锯 vi. 裂开，被撕裂 n. 裂口，裂缝
`cord` [] / v 绳索
`pilot` [paɪlət] / n.飞行员；领航员
`chute` [ʃut] / 降落伞 
`thrust` [θrʌst] /  n. [力] 推力；刺 vt. 插；插入；推挤
`canopy` ['kænəpi] / n. 天篷；华盖；遮篷；苍穹vt. 用天蓬遮盖；遮盖
`conscious` ['kɑnʃəs] /  adj. 意识到的；故意的；

Instinctively, I reached for my rip cord and pulled. The pilot chute jettisoned from its small pouch in the back of the parachute but wrapped around my leg as I continued to tumble toward the ground. As I struggled to untangle myself the situation got worse. The main parachute partially deployed but in doing so twirled around my other leg.
`instinctively` [in'stiŋktivli] /  adv. 本能地
`jettisoned` ['dʒɛtɪsn] /  n. 投弃；投弃货物 vt. 投弃
`tumble` ['tʌmbl] / vi. 摔倒；倒塌；滚动；打滚；仓惶地行动 vt. 使摔倒；使滚翻；弄乱 n. 跌倒；翻筋斗；跌跤
`untangle` [ʌn'tæŋɡl] / vt. 清理；整顿；解开…纠结
`twirled` [twɜːrl] / v.（使）旋转，转动；使轻快地转动；（用手指）缠绕，捻弄 n.转动，旋转（一周）；螺旋形曲线；旋转的东西

Craning my neck toward the sky, I could see my legs were bound by two sets of risers, the long nylon straps that connect the main parachute to the harness on my back. One riser had wrapped around one leg, the other riser around the other leg. The main parachute was fully out of the backpack but hung up somewhere on my body.
`crane` [kren] /n. 吊车，起重机；鹤 vi. 伸着脖子看；迟疑，踌躇 vt. 用起重机起吊；伸长脖子

As I struggled to break free of the entanglement, suddenly I felt the canopy lift off my body and begin to open. Looking toward my legs, I knew what was coming next.
`entanglement` [ɪn'tæŋɡlmənt] / n. 纠缠；铁丝网；缠绕物；牵连

Within seconds, the canopy caught air. The two risers, one wrapped around each leg, suddenly and violently pulled apart, taking my legs with them. My pelvis separated instantly as the force of the opening ripped my lower torso. The thousand small muscles that connect the pelvis to the body were torn from their hinges.
`violently` ['vaɪələntli] / adv. 猛烈地，激烈地
`apart` [ə'pɑrt] / adv. 相距；与众不同地；分离着 adj. 分离的；与众不同的
`torso` ['tɔrso] / n. 躯干；裸体躯干雕像
`hinges` / . [机] 铰链；合页（hinge的复数）；小五金 v. 给…装上绞链；使以…为条件
`torn` [] / v. 扯裂，撕开

My mouth dropped open and I let out a scream that could be heard in Mexico. Searing pain arched through my body, sending waves pulsating downward to my pelvis and upward to my head. Violent, muscular convulsions racked my upper torso, shooting more pain through my arms and legs. Now, like having an out-of-body experience, I became aware of my screaming and tried to control it, but the pain was too intense.
`searing` ['sɪrɪŋ] / adj. 灼热的 v. 使枯萎（sear的ing形式）
`arched` [ɑrtʃt] / adj. 拱形的；有拱的；弓形结构的 v. 成弓形弯曲；成弓形
`pelvis` [ˈpelvɪs] /  n.骨盆
`muscular` ['mʌskjəlɚ] / adj. 肌肉的；肌肉发达的；强健的
`convulsion` [kənˈvʌlʃnz] / n. [内科]抽搐；社会动乱；哄堂大笑；震动
`rack` [ræk] / n. [机] 齿条；架子；拷问台 vi. 变形；随风飘；小步跑 vt. 折磨；榨取
`intense` [ɪn'tɛns] / adj. 强烈的；紧张的；非常的；热情的

Still head down and falling too fast, I turned myself upright in the harness, relieving some of the pressure on my pelvis and back.

I had fallen over four thousand feet before the parachute deployed. The good news: I had a full canopy over my head. The bad news: I was broken apart by the impact of the opening.
`relieve` vt. 解除，减轻；使不单调乏味
`apart by` 分开 by

 landed over two miles from the drop zone. Within a few minutes the drop zone crew and an ambulance arrived. I was taken to the trauma hospital in downtown San Diego. By the next day I was out of surgery. The accident had ripped my pelvis apart by almost five inches. The muscles in my stomach had become detached from the pelvic bone and the muscles in my back and legs were severely damaged from the opening shock. I had a large titanium plate screwed into my pelvis and a long scapular screw drilled into my backside for stability.
 `downtown` ['daʊn'taʊn] / adv. 往闹市区；在市区 adj. 市中心的
 `surgery` ['sɝdʒəri] / n. 外科；外科手术；手术室；诊疗室
 `detached` [dɪ'tætʃt] / adj. 分离的，分开的；超然的 v.分离
 `titanium`  [taɪ'tenɪəm;] / 钛
 `screwed`   vt. 旋，拧；压榨；强迫 n. 螺旋；螺丝钉；吝啬鬼
 `scapular` [ˈskæpjələr] /  n. 肩胛；修道士的肩衣；肩羽
 `drill` [drɪl] / adj. 钻过孔的 v. 钻孔

 This seemed like the end of my career. To be an effective SEAL you had to be physically fit. My rehabilitation was going to take months, maybe years, and the Navy was required to conduct a medical evaluation to determine if I was fit for duty. I left the hospital seven days later but remained bedridden at my home for the next two months.
 `evaluation` [ɪ,væljʊ'eʃən] / n. 评价；[审计] 评估
 `bedridden` ['bɛdrɪdn] / adj. 卧床不起的
 `rehabilitation` [riːəˌbɪlɪ'teʃn] / n. 复原

 All my life I had the feeling I was invincible. I believed that my innate athletic abilities could get me out of most perilous situations. And, up to this point, I had been right. Many times during my career I had encountered life-threatening incidents: midair collisions in another parachute; uncontrolled descent in a minisub; nearly falling hundreds of feet off an oil rig; getting trapped beneath a sinking boat; demolition that exploded prematurely(过早爆炸的拆卸工程); and countless more—incidents where a split second(每一秒) decided the fate between living and dying. Each time I had somehow managed to make the right decision, and each time I was physically fit enough to overcome the challenge before me. Not this time.
`invincible` [ɪn'vɪnsəbl] / adj. 无敌的；不能征服的
`innate` [ɪ'net] / adj. 先天的；固有的；与生俱来的
`athletic` [æθ'lɛtɪk] / adj. 运动的，运动员的；体格健壮的
`perilous ` ['pɛrələs] / adj. 危险的，冒险的
`midair collisions` [kə'lɪʒən]  / n. [物] 碰撞；冲突；撞击
`descent`  [dɪ'sɛnt] / n. 下降；血统；袭击 vt. 除去…的气味；使…失去香味
`minisub` [] / 小型潜水艇
`oil rig`  石油钻塔
`trap` [træpt] / adj. 捕获的；陷入困境的；收集的；受到限制的vt. 诱捕

Now, lying in bed, all I felt was self-pity. But that would not last for long. My wife, Georgeann, had been given nursing duties. She cleaned my wounds, gave me the required daily shots, and changed my bedpan. But most importantly, she reminded me of who I was. I had never given up on anything in my life and she assured me that I was not going to start now. She refused to let me feel sorry for myself. It was the kind of tough love that I needed, and as the days went by, I got better.
`self-pity` [] / n. 自怜；自哀
`bedpan` [ˈbedpæn] /  n. 便盆；睡床用脚炉
`assure` [ə'ʃʊrd] / adj. 确定的；自信的
`tough` [tʌf] / adj. 艰苦的，困难的；坚强的，不屈不挠的；坚韧的，牢固的；强壮的，结实的n. 恶棍 vt. 坚持；忍受，忍耐

My friends came by the house, called constantly, and helped with whatever they could. My boss, Admiral Eric Olson somehow found a way around the policy that required the Navy to conduct a medical evaluation of my ability to continue to serve as a SEAL. His support for me likely saved my career.

During my time in the SEAL Teams I had numerous setbacks, and in each case, someone came forward to help me: someone who had faith in my abilities; someone who saw potential in me where others might not; someone who risked their own reputation to advance my career. I have never forgotten those people and I know that anything I achieved in my life was a result of others who have helped me along the way.
`setbacks` ['sɛt,bæk] / n. 挫折；周折（setback复数）
`reputation` [reputation] / n. 名声，名誉；声望

None of us are immune from life’s tragic moments. Like the small rubber boat we had in basic SEAL training, it takes a team of good people to get you to your destination in life. You cannot paddle the boat alone. Find someone to share your life with. Make as many friends as possible, and never forget that your success depends on others.
`immune` [] / adj. 免疫的
`tragic` ['trædʒɪk] / adj. 悲剧的；悲痛的，不幸的

## chapter 3 Only the Size of Your Heart Matters

I ran to the beach with my black, rubber flippers tucked underneath my right arm and my mask in my left hand. Coming to parade rest, I anchored the flippers in the soft sand, leaning them against each other to form a teepee. Standing to my right and left were other students. Dressed in green tee shirts, khaki swim trunks, neoprene booties, and a small life jacket, we were preparing for our morning two-mile swim.
`flippers` ['flipə] / 脚蹼
`parade` [pə'red] / n.阅兵场
`anchored` ['æŋkɚ] / adj. 固定的；抛锚的 v. 固定；抛锚；主持
`teepee` ['tipi] /n. （美）圆锥形帐篷
`trunk` [trʌŋk] / n. 树干；躯干；象鼻；汽车车尾的行李箱 vt. 把…放入旅行箱内
`neoprene` ['niəprin] / n. [橡胶] 氯丁橡胶
`life jacket` / 救生衣

The life jacket was a small, rubberized bladder that inflated only when you pulled the handle. Among the students, it was considered shameful if you had to use your life jacket. Still, the SEAL instructors were required to inspect every life jacket before each swim. This inspection also gave the instructors an opportunity for more harassment.
`inspect` [ɪn'spɛkt] /  vt. 检查；视察；检阅
`harassment` [hə'ræsmənt] / n. 骚扰；烦恼
`rubberized` ['rʌbəraɪzd] / adj. 涂上胶的；橡胶处理的
`bladder` ['blædɚ] / n. 膀胱；囊状物，可充气的囊袋

The surf off Coronado that day was about eight feet high. The waves were coming in lines of three, plunging with a roaring sound that made each student’s heart beat a bit faster. As the instructor slowly moved down the line he came to the man directly to my right. The student, a seaman recruit and brand-new to the Navy, was about five foot four in height. The SEAL instructor, a highly decorated Vietnam vet, was well above six foot two and towered over the smaller man.
`decorated` ['dekəreɪtɪd] / adj. 装饰的，修饰的
`roaring` 美 ['rɔrɪŋ] / adj. 喧闹的；兴胜的；狂风暴雨的 n. 咆哮；怒吼；吼声

After inspecting the student’s life jacket, the instructor looked over his left shoulder toward the pounding surf and then reached down and grabbed the student’s flippers. Holding them close to the young sailor’s face, he said quietly, “Do you really want to be a frogman?”
`look over` 检查，察看；从……上面看；原谅
`pounding`  汹涌澎湃的

The sailor stood up straight, with a look of defiance in his eyes. “Yes, instructor, I do!” he shouted.
“You’re a tiny little man,” the instructor said, waving the flippers in his face. “Those waves out there could break you in half.” He paused and glanced toward the ocean. “You should think about quitting now before you get hurt.”
`defiance` [dɪ'faɪəns] / n. 蔑视；挑战；反抗

Even out of the corner of my eye I could see the student’s jaw begin to tighten.
“I won’t quit!” the sailor replied, drawing out each word. Then the instructor leaned in and whispered something in the student’s ear. I couldn’t make out the words over the breaking waves.
`jaw` [dʒɔ] / n. 颌；下巴；狭窄入口；唠叨
`tighten` ['taɪtn] / vt. 变紧；使变紧
`drawin out` 拉出

After all the trainees were inspected the instructors ordered us into the water, and we began our swim. An hour later, I crawled out of the surf zone, and standing on the beach was the young seaman recruit. He had finished the swim near the head of the class. Later that day, I pulled him aside and asked what the instructor had whispered to him. He smiled and said proudly, “Prove me wrong!”
`near` [nɪr] / adv.距离不远，在附近；不久，很快；差不多，几乎 prep.在......附近，靠近；接近（某时间、某事件）；（用于数字前）接近；

SEAL training was always about proving something. Proving that size didn’t matter. Proving that the color of your skin wasn’t important. Proving that money didn’t make you better. Proving that determination and grit were always more important than talent. I was fortunate to learn that lesson a year before training began.
`grit` [ɡrɪt] / n.粗砂，砂砾砂砾，粗砂石；勇气；决心 vt. 研磨；在…上铺砂砾，覆以砂砾；咬紧牙关

As I boarded the city bus in downtown San Diego I was excited about the prospect of visiting the basic SEAL training facility across the bay in Coronado. I was a first-class midshipman attending my summer cruise as part of the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corp (ROTC) program. As a first-class midshipman I was between my junior and senior years in college, and if all went well, I hoped to be commissioned the following summer and head off to SEAL training. It was the middle of the week and I had received permission from my ROTC instructor to deviate from the planned training aboard one of the ships in port and make my way to Coronado.
`prospect` ['prɑspɛkt] / n. 前途；预期；景色
`cruise` [krʊz] vi. 巡航，巡游；漫游
`midshipman` n.海军学生
`reserve` [rɪ'zɝv] n. 储备，储存；自然保护区；
`commissioned` adj. 受委任的，受任命的；服役的，现役的
`deviate` ['divɪet] v.偏离
`port` 港口

I got off the bus outside the famed Hotel del Coronado and walked about a mile down the road to the beach side of the Naval Amphibious Base. I passed by several Korean War–vintage buildings that housed Underwater Demolition Teams Eleven and Twelve. Outside the one-story rambling brick building was a large wooden sign depicting Freddy the Frog, a large green web-footed amphibian carrying a stick of TNT and smoking a cigar. This was the home of the West Coast frogmen, those intrepid mask-and-fin warriors whose military ancestors had cleared the beaches of Iwo Jima, Tarawa, Guam, and Inchon. My heart began to beat a little faster. This was exactly where I wanted to be in a year.
`famed` 著名的
`Amphibious` [æm'fɪbɪəs] adj. [生物] 两栖的，水陆两用的；具有双重性的
`Demolition ` [dimə'lɪʃən] n. 拆除（等于demolishment）；破坏；毁坏

`ancestor` ['ænsɛstɚ] n. [生物] 祖先，上代；先祖
`intrepid`mask-and-fin warriors [ɪn'trɛpɪd] adj. 无畏的；勇敢的；勇猛的

As I passed the Underwater Demolition Teams the next building belonged to SEAL Team One, at the time a new breed of jungle fighters who had earned their reputation in Vietnam as some of the toughest men in the military. Another large wooden sign showed Sammy the Seal, a dagger in one hand and a dark cloak wrapped around his shoulders. As I would later learn, the frogmen and the SEALs were one and the same. All the men were graduates of SEAL training, all frogmen at heart.
`breed` [brid] n. [生物] 品种；种类，类型
`dagger` 美 ['dæɡɚ] n. 匕首，短剑
`cloak` 美 [klok] n. 斗蓬；宽大外衣；托词vt. 遮掩；隐匿

Finally, I approached the last government building on the beach side of the naval base. On the outer facade of the building it read, BASIC UNDERWATER DEMOLITION SEAL TRAINING. Standing outside the main entrance were two SEAL instructors surrounded by some young high school sea cadets. The two SEALs towered over the high school students. Senior Chief Petty Officer Dick Ray stood six foot three with broad shoulders, a thin waist, a deep tan, and a dark pencil-thin mustache. He was everything I expected a SEAL to look like. Standing next to him was Chief Petty Officer Gene Wence. Well over six feet, Wence was built like a linebacker, with imposing biceps and a steely-eyed glare that cautioned everyone not to get too close.

`caution`  美 ['kɔʃən] n. 小心，谨慎；警告，警示 v.警告

The sea cadets were ushered into the building. With some trepidation, I followed them and stopped at the front desk. I told the young sailor manning the desk my story. I was a midshipman from the University of Texas and hoped to talk with someone about SEAL training. The sailor left his desk momentarily, returning to inform me that the first phase officer, Lieutenant Doug Huth, would be glad to talk with me in a few minutes.
`usher` 美 ['ʌʃɚ] n. 引座员，带位员；接待员；门房 vt. 引导，招待；迎接；开辟
`trepidation` 美 [ˌtrɛpəˈdeʃən] n. 恐惧；惊恐；忧虑；颤抖
`I told the young sailor manning the desk my story` manning是定语从句修饰那个sailor
`momentarily` 美 [,momən'tɛrəli] adv. 随时地；暂时地；立刻

As I waited to be called into Lieutenant Huth’s office I slowly walked up and down the hall, looking at the pictures that adorned the walls. They were photos of SEALs in Vietnam, guys rising out of the waist-deep mud along the Mekong Delta. Pictures of camouflaged SEAL platoons returning from a night mission. Men loaded with automatic weapons and bandoliers of ammunition (who)boarding a Swift boat heading into the jungle.
`mud` n. 泥；诽谤的话；无价值的东西
`platnoon` 美 [plə'tun] n. 排，团；一组
`bandolier` 美 [ˌbændəˈlɪr] n. 子弹带，弹药带
`camouflaged` ['kæmuflɑ:ʒ] adj. 伪装的 vt. 伪装；
`ammunition` [,æmju'nɪʃən] n. 弹药；军火 vt. 装弹药于

Down the long hall I saw another man looking at the photos. A civilian by his attire, he was slightly built, almost frail, and a mop of dark hair hung Beatle-like over his ears. He seemed to be staring in awe at the incredible warriors whose actions were portrayed in the photos. In my mind, I wondered if he thought he had what it took to be a Navy SEAL. Looking at those pictures, did he really think he was tough enough to endure the training? Did he think his small frame could carry a heavy rucksack and a thousand rounds of ammunition? Hadn’t he seen the two SEAL instructors who were just at the front door? Massive men who clearly had the right stuff? I felt a pang of sorrow that someone had misled this fellow, maybe encouraged him to leave his comfortable life as a civilian and try SEAL training.
`attire` /美 [ə'taɪə] n. 服装；盛装
`frail`  美 [frel] adj. 脆弱的；虚弱的
`a mop of dark hair`  短头发
`beatle-like` ['bi:təl] n. 小妞；有男子气概的新女性
`portray` 美 [pɔr'tre] vt. 描绘；扮演
`sorrow`  美 [sɑro] n. 悲伤；懊悔；伤心事

A few minutes later, the sailor from the front desk calmly walked down the corridor and escorted me to Lieutenant Huth’s office. Doug Huth was also a recruiting poster for the SEALs; tall, muscular, with brown, wavy hair, he looked very sharp in his Navy khaki uniform.
`wavy` 美 ['wevi] adj. 多浪的；波动起伏的
`look very sharp` 非常醒目

I sat in a chair across from Huth’s desk, and we talked about SEAL training and the demands of the program. Huth told me about his experience in Vietnam and what life would be like in the Teams if I graduated from SEAL training. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the thin man in civilian clothes as he continued to gaze at the photos on the wall. Like me, he must have been waiting to see Lieutenant Huth in hopes of learning more about SEAL training. It made me feel good about myself knowing that I was clearly stronger and more prepared than another man who thought he could survive the rigors of being a SEAL.
`gaze` 美 [ɡeɪz] vi. 凝视；注视
`in hopes of` - `in favor of`
`rigor` 美 ['rɪgɚ] n. 严厉；精确；苛刻；僵硬

In the middle of our conversation, Lieutenant Huth suddenly stopped talking, looked up from his desk, and yelled to the man in the hall. I stood up as Huth motioned the thin man to come into his office.
“Bill, this is Tommy Norris,” he said, giving the thin man a big bear hug. “Tommy was the last SEAL Medal of Honor recipient from Vietnam,” Huth added. Norris smiled, somewhat embarrassed by the introduction. I smiled back, shook his hand, and laughed at myself. This seemingly frail, mop-haired man who I doubted could make it through training was Lieutenant Tom Norris. Tom Norris, who had served in Vietnam, had on successive nights gone deep behind enemy lines to rescue two downed airmen. This was Tom Norris who, on another mission, was shot in the face by North Vietnamese forces and left for dead only to be rescued by Petty Officer Mike Thornton, who would later receive the Medal of Honor for those actions. This was Tom Norris, who battled back from his injury to be accepted into the FBI’s first Hostage Rescue Team. This quiet, reserved, humble man was one of the toughest SEALs in the long history of the Teams.
`recipient` [rɪ'sɪpɪənt] n. 容器，接受者；容纳者
`somewhat` 美 ['sʌmwʌt] n. 几分；某物
`toughest` 美 [tʌf] adj. 最坚强的；最坚韧的
`reserved`  美 [rɪ'zɝvd] adj. 保留的，预订的；

In 1969, Tommy Norris was almost booted out of SEAL training. They said he was too small, too thin, and not strong enough. But much like the young sailor in my class, Norris proved them all wrong and once again showed that it’s not the size of your flippers that count, just the size of your heart.

## chapter 4 drive on!

get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward.
`get over` 克服；恢复；熬过；原谅

I ran to the top of the sand dune and without hesitation sprinted down the other side, heading full speed toward the Pacific Ocean. Fully clothed in my green utilities, short-billed hat, and combat boots, I dove headfirst into the waves as they pounded the beach off Coronado, California.

`sprint` 美 [sprɪnt] vi. 冲刺，全速跑
`utilities` 美 [ju'tɪlətiz] n. 公用事业；实用工具，[计] 实用程序 (这里应该是指战斗服)
`short-bill hat` 鸭舌帽
`dove` n.鸽子；鸽派人 v.跳水；潜水

Emerging soaking wet from the water, I saw the SEAL instructor standing on the dune. With his arms folded and a piercing glare that cut through the morning haze, I heard him yell, “You know what to do, Mr. Mac!”
Indeed I did.
With feigned enthusiasm, I screamed a hearty “hooyah” at the top of my lungs and fell facedown into the soft sand, rolling from side to side to ensure that no part of my uniform was left uncovered. Then, for good measure, I sat up, reached deep into the ground, and tossed sand into the air to guarantee it found its way into every crevice in my body.
`emerging` 英/美 [ɪ'mɝdʒɪŋ] adj. 新兴的；出现的；形成的v. 形成；浮现；显露（emerge的ing形式）；由…中脱出
`soaking`  ['sokɪŋ] n. 浸湿，浸透
`wet` 美 [wɛt] adj. [气象][物] 潮湿的；有雨的

`hearty` ['hɑrti] adj. 衷心的；丰盛的；健壮的；精神饱满的
`facedown` ['fes,daʊn] n. （美）直接对抗；摊牌 adv. 面向下地
`crevice` ['krɛvɪs] n. 裂缝；裂隙
`toss`  美 [tɔs] n. 投掷；摇荡；vt. 投掷

Somewhere during the morning’s physical training I had “committed a violation of the SEAL training rules.” My punishment was to jump into the surf zone, roll around in the sand, and make myself a “sugar cookie.”
`somewhere` 在某处
`violation` [,vaɪə'leʃən] n. 违反；妨碍

In all of SEAL training there was nothing more uncomfortable than being a sugar cookie. There were a lot of things more painful and more exhausting, but being a sugar cookie tested your patience and your determination. Not just because you spent the rest of the day with sand down your neck, under your arms, and between your legs, but because the act of becoming a sugar cookie was completely indiscriminate. There was no rhyme or reason. You became a sugar cookie at the whim of the instructor.
`neck` n.脖子 v.变窄 
`indiscriminate` [ɪndɪ'skrɪmɪnət] adj. 任意的；无差别的；
`rhyme` [raɪm] n. 韵律；韵脚 v 使押韵
`whim`  美 [wɪm]n. 奇想；一时的兴致；怪念头；幻想

To many of the SEAL trainees this was hard to accept. Those that strived to be the very best expected that they would be rewarded for their stellar performance. Sometimes they were and, then again, sometimes they were not. Sometimes the only thing they got for all their effort was wet and sandy.
`reward`  美 [rɪ'wɔrd] n. [劳经] 报酬；报答；酬谢
`stellar` [ˈstelər] adj. 星的；星球的；主要的；一流的
`strived`  [straɪv] v. 努力，力争；斗争，反抗

Feeling like I was sufficiently coated with sand, I ran to the instructor, yelled “hooyah” again, and came to attention. Looking me over to see if I met his standard of excellence in sugar cookies was Lieutenant Phillip L. Martin, known to his friends as Moki. I, however, was not on a first-name basis with Lieutenant Martin.
`basis`['besɪs] n. 基础；底部；主要成分
`first-name` ['fə:stneim] adj. 熟悉的；直呼其名的

Moki Martin was the quintessential frogman. Born and raised in Hawaii, he was everything I strived to be as a SEAL officer. An experienced Vietnam veteran, he was expert with every weapon in the SEAL inventory. He was one of the finest skydivers in the Teams, and being a native Hawaiian, he was so skilled in the water that there were few, if any, who could match him.
`quintessential` [,kwɪntɪ'sɛnʃəl] adj. 精髓的，精萃的
`veteran` ['vɛtərən] n. 老兵；老手；富有经验的人；老运动员 adj. 经验丰富的

“Mr. Mac, do you have any idea why you are a sugar cookie this morning?” Martin said in a very calm but questioning manner.

“No, Instructor Martin,” I dutifully responded.
`dutifully` ['du:tɪfəli] adv. 忠实地；忠贞地
“Because, Mr. Mac, life isn’t fair and the sooner you learn that the better off you will be.”
因为，麦克先生，生活是不公平的，你越早知道，你就会越好

A year later, Lieutenant Martin and I were on a first-name basis. I had completed basic SEAL training, and he had been reassigned from the training center to Underwater Demolition Team Eleven in Coronado.

The more I got to know Moki, the deeper my respect grew for him. In addition to being a superb SEAL operator, Moki was also a phenomenal athlete. In the early 1980s, he was on the leading edge of the triathlon craze. He had a beautiful freestyle stroke in the open ocean. His calves and thighs were strong and moved him effortlessly on the long runs, but his real advantage was the bicycle. He and the bike were made for each other.
`phenomenal` [fɪ'nɒmɪn(ə)l] adj. 现象的；显著的；异常的
`triathlon craze` 铁人三项
`freestyle stroke` 自由泳
`calves` [kævz] n. 小牛；小腿
`thigh`  美 [θaɪ] n. 大腿，股

Every morning he would mount the bike and go for a thirty-mile ride up and down the Coronado Silver Strand. There was a flat stretch of paved bike path that paralleled the Pacific Ocean. It ran from the city of Coronado to the city of Imperial Beach. With the ocean on one side and the bay on the other, it was one of the most beautiful sections of beach in California.
`flat` 平的
`paved` [peiv] 铺砌面

Early one Saturday morning, Moki was out on a training ride along the Silver Strand. Head down, pedaling fast, he never saw the oncoming bicycle. At roughly twenty-five miles an hour the two bikes collided head-on. The bikes crumpled from the impact, slamming the riders together, leaving both men facedown on the asphalt path. The first rider rolled over, dusted himself off, and struggled to his feet. He was banged up but otherwise fine.
`collided`[kə'laid] v. 碰撞，冲突
`crumpled` ['krʌmpld] adj. 摺皱的，弄皱的
`slamming`['slæmiŋ]  n. 砰击
`banged up` 伤痕累累 

Moki remained facedown, unable to move. The paramedics arrived within minutes, stabilized Moki, and transported him to the hospital. Initially there was hope that the paralysis was temporary, but as the days, months, and years passed, Moki never regained the use of his legs. The crash left him paralyzed from the waist down with limited movement in his arms.
`paralyzed` 英/美 ['pærəlaizd] adj. 瘫痪的；麻痹的 v. 使麻痹；使无力
`regained` [rɪ'ɡen] vt. 恢复；重新获得

For the past thirty-five years, Moki has been in a wheelchair. In all those years I never once heard him complain about his misfortune in life. Never once did I hear him ask, “Why me?” Never once did he display an ounce of pity for himself.
`pity`  美 ['pɪti] n. 怜悯，同情；遗憾 vt. 对……表示怜悯

In fact, after his accident, Moki went on to be an accomplished painter. He fathered a beautiful young girl. He founded and continues to oversee the Super Frog Triathlon that is held every year in Coronado.
`father` v
`oversee` 监督
`Triathlon` 三项全能运动
It is easy to blame your lot in life on some outside force, to stop trying because you believe fate is against you. It is easy to think that where you were raised, how your parents treated you, or what school you went to is all that determines your future. Nothing could be further from the truth. The common people and the great men and women are all defined by how they deal with life’s unfairness: Helen Keller, Nelson Mandela, Stephen Hawking, Malala Yousafzai, and—Moki Martin.
很容易认为，你在哪里长大
Sometimes no matter how hard you try, no matter how good you are, you still end up as a sugar cookie. Don’t complain. Don’t blame it on your misfortune. Stand tall, look to the future, and drive on!

## chapter 5 failure can make you stronger

The waves off Coronado Island were choppy, the small whitecaps slapping us in the face as we sidestroked back toward the beach. As usual, my swim buddy and I were struggling to keep up with the rest of the SEAL training class. The instructors on the safety boat were yelling for us to pick up the pace, but it seemed like the harder we swam the farther we fell behind.
`choppy` 美 ['tʃɑpi] adj. 波涛汹涌的；波浪起伏的；不断改变方向的 n. (Choppy)人名；(法)肖皮
`slapping`  ['slæpiŋ] adj. 非常快的；非常大的；极好的 adv. 极快地；非常地 v. 拍打（slap的ing形式）
`sidestoked` 美 [ˈsaɪdstroʊk] n. 侧泳 vi. 游侧泳
My swim buddy that day was Ensign Marc Thomas. Like me, Marc had received his commission through the Reserve Officers Training Corps (ROTC). He was a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute and one of the best long-distance runners in the class.
`commiission` 美 [kə'mɪʃən] n. 委员会；佣金；犯；委任；委任状 vt. 委任；使服役；委托制作
`reserve` [rɪ'zɝv] n. 储备，储存；自然保护区；预备队；缄默；[金融] 储备金 vt. 储备；保留；预约
`dive` 美 [daɪv] vi. 潜水；跳水；俯冲；急剧下降 n. 潜水；跳水；俯冲；扑
In SEAL training your swim buddy was the person you relied on to have your back. It was your swim buddy who you were physically tied to on the underwater dives. It was your swim buddy who you were partnered with (who) on the long swims. Your swim buddy helped you study, kept you motivated, and became your closest ally throughout training. And, as swim buddies, if one of you failed an event, both of you suffered the consequences. It was the instructors’ way of reinforcing the importance of teamwork.
`ally` 美 ['ælaɪ] n. 同盟国；伙伴；同盟者；助手 vt. 使联盟；使联合

As we finished the swim and crossed onto the beach, a SEAL instructor was waiting for us.

“Drop down!” the instructor yelled. This was the command to fall into the push-up position: back straight, arms fully extended, and head up.

“You two call yourselves officers?” There was no point in answering. We both knew he would continue.

“Officers in the SEAL Teams lead the way. They don’t come in last on the swims. They don’t embarrass their class.”
他们不会在游泳比赛中排在最后。他们不会让他们的班级难堪
The instructor moved around us, kicking sand in our faces as he circled.

“I don’t think you gentlemen are going to make it. I don’t think you have what it takes to be SEAL officers.”

Pulling a small black notebook from his back pocket, he looked at us with disgust and jotted something in the book. “You two just made The Circus list.” He shook his head. “You’ll be lucky if you survive another week.”
`disgust` 美 [dɪs'ɡʌst] n. 厌恶，嫌恶 vt. 使厌恶；使作呕
`jotted` 美 ['dʒɔtid] v. 摘记下来
`circus` 美 ['sɝkəs] n. 马戏；马戏团
The Circus. It was the last thing either Marc or I wanted. The Circus was held every afternoon at the end of training. The Circus was another two hours of additional calisthenics, combined with nonstop harassment by SEAL combat veterans who wanted only the strong to survive training. If you failed to meet the standard on any event that day—calisthenics, the obstacle course, the timed runs, or the swims—your name was on the list. In the eyes of the instructors, you were a failure.
`calisthenics` 美 [,kælɪs'θɛnɪks] n. 健美体操
`veterans` 美 ['vetərənz] n. 老兵；退伍军人
What made The Circus so feared by the students was not just the additional pain but also the knowledge that the day after The Circus you would be exhausted from the extra workout and so fatigued that you would fail to meet the standards again. Another Circus would follow, then another and another. It was a death spiral, a cycle of failure that caused many students to quit training.
`fatigued` 美 [fə'tiɡd] adj. 疲乏的
`exhausted` 美 [ɪɡ'zɔstɪd] adj. 疲惫的；耗尽的
`workout` 锻炼
As the rest of the students completed the day’s events, Marc and I, along with several others, assembled on the asphalt grinder to begin another long session of calisthenics.

Because we had come in last on the swim, the instructors had tailored The Circus just for us that day. Flutter kicks. Lots and lots of flutter kicks. The flutter kicks were designed to strengthen your abdominals and thighs so you could power your way through the long open ocean swims. They were also designed to break you.

The flutter kick exercise called for you to lie on your back, with legs extended directly in front of you, and your hands behind your head. As the instructor counted repetitions, you alternated moving your legs up and down in a kicking motion. At no time during the exercise were you allowed to bend your knees. Bending your knees was considered weakness among frogmen.

The Circus was punishing. Hundreds of flutter kicks as well as push-ups, pull-ups, sit-ups, and eight-count body builders. By the time the sun went down Marc and I could barely move. Failure had a price.

The next day brought more calisthenics, another run, another obstacle course, another swim, and unfortunately another Circus. More sit-ups, more push-ups, and a lot more flutter kicks. But as The Circuses continued a funny thing happened. Our swims got better, and Marc and I began to move up in the pack.

The Circus, which had started as a punishment for failure, was making us stronger, faster, and more confident in the water. While other students quit, unable to handle the occasional failure and the pain   it brought, Marc and I were determined not to allow The Circus to beat us.
`occasional` 美 [ə'keʒənl] adj. 偶然的；临时的；特殊场合的

As training was coming to an end, there was one final open ocean swim, a five-miler off the coast of San Clemente Island. Completing it in the allowable time was essential to graduating from SEAL training.

The water was bitterly cold as we jumped off the pier and into the ocean. Fifteen swim pairs entered the water and began the long trek out of the small bay, around the peninsula, and over the kelp beds. After about two hours, the swim pairs were so spread out you couldn’t tell where you were in the pack. Four hours into the swim, numb, exhausted, and on the verge of hypothermia, Marc Thomas and I crossed the beach. There waiting at the surf’s edge was the instructor.
`pier`  [pɪr] n. 码头，直码头；桥墩；窗间壁
`trek` 美 [trɛk] n. 艰苦跋涉 vt. （牛）拉（货车）；搬运 vi. 艰苦跋涉
`verge` 美 [vɝdʒ] vi. 濒临，接近；处在边缘 n. 边缘
`numb` 麻木
`hypothermia` 美 [,haɪpə'θɝmɪə] n. 降低体温；低体温症
“Drop down,” he yelled.

My hands and feet were so cold I couldn’t feel the sand beneath my fingers and toes. With my head straining to keep upright, all I could see was the instructor’s boots as he walked around Marc and me.

“Once again you two officers have embarrassed your class.” Another set of boots appeared in my view and then another. Several instructors were now surrounding us. “You have made all your teammates look bad.” He paused. “Recover, gentlemen!”

As Marc and I got to our feet we looked around the beach and suddenly realized we were the first swim pair to finish.

“You embarrassed them all right.” The instructor smiled. “The second pair isn’t even in sight.”
`sight`  美 [saɪt] n. 视力；景象；眼界；见解 vt. 看见；瞄准 vi. 瞄准；观看 adj. 见票即付的
Marc and I turned to look toward the ocean, and sure enough, there was no one in view.

“Well done, gentlemen. It looks like all that extra pain and suffering paid off.” The instructor paused, stepped over, and shook our hands. “I’ll be honored to serve with you when you get to the Teams.”

We had made it. The long swim was the final tough event of training. Several days later Marc and I graduated.

Marc went on to have a distinguished career in the SEAL Teams and we remain close friends to this day.

In life you will face a lot of Circuses. You will pay for your failures. But, if you persevere, if you let those failures teach you and strengthen you, then you will be prepared to handle life’s toughest moments.


July 1983 was one of those tough moments. As I stood before the commanding officer, I thought my career as a Navy SEAL was over. I had just been relieved of my SEAL squadron, fired for trying to change the way my squadron was organized, trained, and conducted missions. There were some magnificent officers and enlisted men in the organization, some of the most professional warriors I had ever been around. However, much of the culture was still rooted in the Vietnam era, and I thought it was time for a change. As I was to find out, change is never easy, particularly for the person in charge.
`squadron` n. 空军中队；一群；骑兵中队；分遣队；小舰队
`magnificent` 美 [mæg'nɪfəsnt] adj. 高尚的；壮丽的；华丽的；宏伟的
`era` 时代
`enlisted` 美 [ɪn'lɪstɪd] adj. 应募入伍的 v. 征募；参军
Fortunately, even though I was fired, my commanding officer allowed me to transfer to another SEAL Team, but my reputation as a SEAL officer was severely damaged. Everywhere I went, other officers and enlisted men knew I had failed, and every day there were whispers and subtle reminders that maybe I wasn’t up to the task of being a SEAL.
`severly` 严重的
`subtle`  美 ['sʌtl] adj. 微妙的；精细的；敏感的；狡猾的；稀薄的
也许我不能胜任海豹突击队的任务

At that point in my career I had two options: quit and move on to civilian life, which seemed like the logical choice in light of my recent Officer Fitness Report, or weather the storm and prove to others and myself that I was a good SEAL officer. I chose the latter.
`weather` 美 ['wɛðɚ] n. 天气；气象；气候；处境 vt. 经受住；使风化；侵蚀；使受风吹雨打 vi. 风化；受侵蚀；经受风雨
Soon after being fired, I was given a second chance, an opportunity to deploy overseas as the Officer in Charge of a SEAL platoon. Most of the time on that overseas deployment we were in remote locations, isolated and on our own. I took advantage of the opportunity to show that I could still lead. When you live in close quarters with twelve SEALs there isn’t anywhere to hide. They know if you are giving 100 percent on the morning workout. They see when you are first in line to jump out of the airplane and last in line to get the chow. They watch you clean your weapon, check your radio, read the intelligence, and prepare your mission briefs. They know when you have worked all night preparing for tomorrow’s training.
`in charge of` 管理
`in favor of` 有利于 
`chow` 美 [tʃaʊ] n. 食物；中国狗（体壮，有褐或黑色厚毛，舌为深蓝色） vi. 吃
As month after month of the overseas deployment wore on, I used my previous failure as motivation to outwork, outhustle, and outperform everyone in the platoon. I sometimes fell short of being the best, but I never fell short of giving it my best.
随着海外部署的月复一月的进行，我把以前的失败作为动力，在排里比别人更努力、更勤奋、更出色。我有时没有成为最好的，但我从来没有忘记付出我的努力。
In time, I regained the respect of my men. Several years later I was selected to command a SEAL Team of my own. Eventually I would go on to command all the SEALs on the West Coast.

By 2003, I found myself in combat in Iraq/伊拉克/ and Afghanistan/阿富汗/. Now that I was a one-star admiral leading troops in a war zone, every decision I made had its consequences. Over the next several years, I stumbled often. But, for every failure, for every mistake, there were hundreds of successes: hostages rescued, suicide bombers stopped, pirates captured, terrorists killed, and countless lives saved.
`stumble` 美 ['stʌmbl] 绊倒 蹒跚
`rescued` 
I realized that the past failures had strengthened me, taught me that no one is immune from mistakes. True leaders must learn from their failures, use the lessons to motivate themselves, and not be afraid to try again or make the next tough decision.
`immune` 英 [ɪ'mjuːn]  美 [ɪ'mjʊn] adj. 免疫的；免于……的，免除的 n. 免疫者；免除者
You can’t avoid The Circus. At some point we all make the list. Don’t be afraid of The Circus.
我们都会被列入名单

## chapter 6 You Must Dare Greatly
你必须大无畏（how dare you）
slide down the obstacle headfirst.

Standing at the edge of the thirty-foot tower, I grabbed the thick nylon rope. One end of the rope was attached to the tower and the other end anchored on the ground to a pole one hundred feet away. I was halfway through the SEAL obstacle course and I was on a record pace. Swinging my legs over the top of the line and holding on for dear life, I began to inch my way off the platform. My body hung underneath the rope, and with a caterpillar-like motion I slowly made my way, foot by foot, to the other end.
`grabbe` /美 [græbd] v. 攫取；捕获；强夺；匆忙地做
`rope`  美 [rop] n. 绳，绳索 vt. 捆，  vi. 拧成绳状
`thick` 英 [θɪk]  美 [θɪk]n. 最拥挤部分；活动最多部分；事物的粗大浓密部分adj. 厚的；浓的；粗大的adv. 密集地；浓浓地，厚厚地

`motion` n,v 运动

As I reached the end, I released my grip on the line, dropped into the soft sand, and ran to the next obstacle. The other students in my class were yelling encouragement, but I could hear the SEAL instructor calling out the minutes. I had lost a lot of time on the Slide for Life. My “possum-style” technique of negotiating the long rope was just too slow, but somehow I couldn’t bring myself to slide down the rope headfirst. Going headfirst off the tower, using a method called Commando Style, was much faster but also much riskier. You were less stable on the top of the rope than hanging underneath, and if you fell and injured yourself, you would be washed out of the class.
`grip` 美 [ɡrɪp] n. 紧握；柄；支配；握拍方式；拍柄绷带 vt. 紧握；夹紧 vi. 抓住
`encouragement`  美 [ɪn'kɝɪdʒmənt] n. 鼓励

I crossed the finish line with a disappointing time. As I was doubled over, trying to catch my breath, a grizzled old Vietnam vet with highly polished boots and a heavily starched green uniform stood hunched over me. “When are you going to learn, Mr. Mac?” he said with an unmistakable tone of contempt. “That obstacle course is going to beat you every time unless you start taking some risks.”  
试图喘口气时
`grizzed` 英 ['grɪz(ə)ld] adj. 灰色的；头发斑白的 v. 变成灰色；发脾气（grizzle的过去分词）
`polished`  美 ['pɑlɪʃt] adj. 擦亮的；优美的；圆滑的 v. 擦亮（polish的过去式和过去分词）

One week later, I pushed my fears aside, mounted the top of the rope, and thrust my body headfirst down the Slide for Life. As I crossed the finish line in a personal best, I could see the old Vietnam SEAL nodding his approval. It was a simple lesson in overcoming your anxieties and trusting your abilities to get the job done. The lesson would serve me well in the years to come.
`anxieties` 美 [æŋ'zaɪətiz] 担心 渴望

It was Iraq in 2004. The voice on the other end of the radio was calm but had an unmistakable sense of urgency. The three hostages we were searching for had been located. Al Qaeda terrorists were holding them in a walled compound on the outskirts of Baghdad. Unfortunately, intelligence indicated that terrorists were about to move the men, and we had to act quickly.
`urgency` 美 ['ɝdʒənsi] n. 紧急；催促；紧急的事
`outskirt`  美 ['aʊt'skɝts] n. 市郊，郊区
`compound`  美 ['kɑmpaʊnd] n. [化学] 化合物；混合物；复合词 adj. 复合的；混合的 v. 合成；混合；恶化，加重；和解，妥协

The Army lieutenant colonel in charge of the rescue mission informed me that they would have to conduct a dangerous daylight raid. To make matters worse, the only way to be successful was to land three Black Hawk helicopters, carrying the assault force, into the middle of the small compound. We talked through other tactical options, but it was clear the colonel was right. It was always preferable to conduct a rescue mission at night, when the element of surprise was on your side, but this was a fleeting opportunity, and if we didn’t act now the hostages would be moved and possibly killed.
`in charge of` 负责
`colonel` 美 ['kɝnl] n. 陆军上校
`conduct` 美 [kən'dʌkt] vi. 导电；带领 vt. 管理；引导；表现 n. 进行；行为；实施

`fleeting`  美 ['flitɪŋ] adj. 飞逝的；转瞬间的
`assault` 美 [ə'sɔlt] n. 攻击；袭击 vt. 攻击；袭击 vi. 袭击；动武

I approved the mission and within minutes the rescue force had boarded the three Black Hawk helicopters and was on its way to the compound. High above the Black Hawks, another helicopter was providing video surveillance back to my headquarters. I watched in silence as the three helicopters skimmed across the desert, just a few feet above the ground to hide their approach.
`surveillance` 美 [sɝ'veləns] n. 监督；监视

Inside the open courtyard, I could see one man, armed with an automatic weapon, moving in and out of the building, seemingly preparing to leave. The helos were five minutes out and all I could do from my headquarters was listen to the internal communications as the rescue force made final preparations.
`helos` n. 直升机

This was not the first hostage rescue I had overseen, nor would it be the last, but it was clearly the most daring, in light of the need to gain surprise by landing inside the compound. While the pilots from the Army aviation unit were the best in the world, this was still a high-risk mission. Three helicopters, with blades extending beyond sixty feet, were going to land in a space with only inches to spare. Adding to the level of difficulty was an eight-foot-high brick wall that surrounded the compound, forcing the pilots to dramatically alter their approach angle. It was going to be a hard landing, and over the radio I could hear the rescue force preparing for impact.
`aviation` 航空
`blades` 美 [bledz] n. [机] 刀片（blade的复数）
`inches` n. 英寸
`brick` 美 [brɪk] n. 砖，砖块；砖形物；心肠好的人 vt. 用砖砌 adj. 用砖做的；似砖的
`angle` 美 ['æŋɡl] vi. 钓鱼；谋取 n. 角度，角，方面

From the overhead surveillance, I could see the helicopters’ final approach. The first aircraft flew flat and level and then as it crossed over the wall the helo flared upward, settling into the tiny courtyard. Immediately the rescue force exited the Black Hawk and began surging into the building. The second helo, right on the tail of the first, landed within a few feet of his companion. Dirt from the downwash of the helicopters caused a cloud of dust to encircle the landing area. As the third helo approached the compound, a giant plume of dust temporarily blinded the pilot. The front of the third helo inched over the wall, but the rear wheel clipped the eight-foot-high barricade, throwing bricks everywhere. With no room to spare, the pilot forced the helo to the ground with a thud, but everyone inside was unharmed.
`flat` 英 [flæt]  美 [flæt]adj. 平的；单调的；不景气的；干脆的；平坦的；扁平的；浅的adv. （尤指贴着另一表面）平直地；断然地；水平地；直接地，完全地n. 平地；公寓；平面vt. 使变平；[音乐]使（音调）下降，尤指降半音vi. 逐渐变平；[音乐]以降调唱（或奏）n. （法）弗拉特（人名）；（英）弗莱特（人名）

`Dirt`  美 [dɝt] n. 污垢，泥土；灰尘，尘土；下流话

`thud` 英 [θʌd]  美 [θʌd] n. 砰的一声；重击 vi. 砰的一声掉下；发出砰声 vt. 砰地击中

Minutes later, I received word that all the hostages were safe. Within thirty minutes the rescue force and the freed men were on their way back to safety. The gamble had paid off.
`gamble` 赌博

Over the course of the next decade I would come to realize that assuming risk was typical of our special operations forces. **They always pushed the limits of themselves and their machines in order to be successful. In many ways this is what set them apart from everyone else**. However, contrary to what outsiders saw, the risk was usually calculated, thoughtful, and well planned. Even if it was spontaneous, the operators knew their limits but believed in themselves enough to try.
`apart` 英 [ə'pɑːt]  美 [ə'pɑrt] adv. 相距；与众不同地；分离着 adj. 分离的；与众不同的
`contrary` 英 ['kɒntrərɪ]  美 ['kɑntrɛri] adj. 相反的；对立的 adv. 相反地 n. 相反；反面
`spontaneous` 英 [spɒn'teɪnɪəs]  美 [spɑn'tenɪəs] adj. 自发的；自然的；无意识的

Throughout my career, I always had great respect for the British Special Air Service, the famed SAS. The SAS motto was “Who Dares Wins.” The motto was so widely admired that even moments before the bin Laden raid, my Command Sergeant Major, Chris Faris, quoted it to the SEALs preparing for the mission. To me the motto was more than about how the British special forces operated as a unit; it was about how each of us should approach our lives.
`motto` n. 座右铭，格言；箴言
`admired` 英 [əd'maɪəd]  美 [əd'maɪəd] adj. 受人钦佩的；感到羡慕的

Life is a struggle and the potential for failure is ever present, but those who live in fear of failure, or hardship, or embarrassment will never achieve their potential. Without pushing your limits, without occasionally sliding down the rope headfirst, without daring greatly, you will never know what is truly possible in your life.
`hardship` 英 ['hɑːdʃɪp]  美 ['hɑrdʃɪp] n. 困苦；苦难；艰难险阻
`embarrassment` 英 [ɪm'bærəsmənt; em-]  美 [ɪm'bærəsmənt] n. 窘迫，难堪；使人为难的人或事物；拮据
`potential` 潜力

## chapter 7 Stand Up to the Bullies
`bullies` 英/美 ['buli] 地痞

don’t **back down from** the sharks.

The water off San Clemente Island was choppy and cold as we began our four-mile night swim. Ensign Marc Thomas was matching my sidestrokes one for one. With nothing but a loose-fitting wet suit top, a mask, and a pair of fins, we swam hard against the current that was pushing southward around the small peninsula. The lights of the naval base from which we had started began to fade as we made our way out into the open ocean(公海). Within an hour we were about a mile off the beach and seemingly all alone in the water. Whatever swimmers were around us were cloaked in darkness.
`fins` 英/美 [fɪn] n. 鳍片，散热翅片；五元纸币（fin的复数形式） v. 切除鳍；装上翅
`peninsula` 半岛
`naval` 英 ['neɪv(ə)l]  美 ['nevl] adj. 海军的；军舰的
`cloak` 英 [kləʊk]  美 [klok]n. 斗蓬；宽大外衣；托词vt. 遮掩；隐匿
`sidestrokes` 侧击
`current` 英 ['kʌr(ə)nt]  美 [kɝ​ənt]adj. 现在的；流通的，通用的；最近的；草写的n. （水，气，电）流；趋势；涌流

I could see Marc’s eyes through the glass in his face mask. His expression must have mirrored mine. We both knew that the waters off San Clemente were filled with sharks. Not just any sharks, but great white sharks, the largest, most aggressive man-eater in the ocean. Prior to our swim, the SEAL instructors had given us a briefing on all the potential threats we might encounter that night. There were leopard sharks, mako sharks, hammerhead sharks, thresher sharks, but the one we feared the most was the great white.
`Not just any sharks, but great white sharks` 不是... 而是...
`prior` 英 ['praɪə]  美 ['praɪɚ] adj. 优先的；在先的，在前的 adv. 在前，居先


There was something a little unnerving about being alone, at night, in the middle of the ocean, knowing that lurking beneath the surface was a prehistoric creature just waiting to bite you in half.
`unnerving` 英/美 [,ʌn'nə:viŋ] adj. 使人紧张不安的 n. 除神经法 v. 使失去气力，使丧失勇气，使焦躁
`lurking` 潜伏
`prehistoric` 

But we both wanted to be SEALs so badly that nothing in the water that night was going to stop us. If we had to fight off the sharks, then we were both prepared to do so. Our goal, which we believed to be honorable and noble, gave us courage, and courage is a remarkable quality. Nothing and nobody can stand in your way. Without it, others will define your path forward. Without it, you are at the mercy of life’s temptations. Without courage, men will be ruled by tyrants and despots. Without courage, no great society can flourish. Without courage, the bullies of the world rise up. With it, you can accomplish any goal. With it, you can defy and defeat evil.
`noble` 英 ['nəʊb(ə)l]  美 ['nobl] adj. 高尚的；贵族的；惰性的；宏伟的
`temptations` 英/美 [temp'teiʃən] n. 诱惑物；引诱物

`defy` 美 ['difaɪ] vt. 藐视；公然反抗；挑衅；使落空 n. 挑战；对抗
`defeat` 美 [dɪ'fit] vt. 击败，战胜；挫败；使…失败 n. 失败的事实；击败的行为

Saddam Hussein, the now former president of Iraq, sat on the edge of an old Army cot clad only in an orange jumpsuit. Having been captured by U.S. forces twenty-four hours earlier, he was now a prisoner of the United States.
`cot` 英 [kɒt]  美 [kɑt] n. 简易床；小屋；轻便小床
`clad` 英 [klæd]  美 [klæd] adj. 穿衣的；覆盖的 vt. 在金属外覆以另一种金属
`jumpsuit` 美 ['dʒʌmp'sʊt] n. 跳伞装；连身衣裤

As I opened the door to allow the new Iraqi government leaders into the room, Saddam remained seated. A smirk crossed his face, and there was no sign of remorse or submission in his attitude. Immediately, the four Iraqi leaders began to yell at Saddam, but from a safe distance. With a look of contempt, Saddam gave them a deadly smile and motioned them to sit down. Still fearful of the former dictator, they each grabbed a folding chair and took their seats. The screaming and finger-pointing continued but slowly subsided as the former dictator began to talk.
`smirk` 美 [smɝk] n. 傻笑；假笑；得意的笑 vi. 傻笑；假笑 vt. 以假笑表示
`contempt`  美 [kən'tɛmpt] n. 轻视，蔑视；耻辱

`subside` 美 [səb'saɪd] vi. 平息；减弱；沉淀；坐下
`dictator` 美 ['dɪktetɚ] n. 独裁者；命令者

Under Saddam Hussein, the Baath Party was responsible for the deaths of thousands of Shia Iraqis and tens of thousands of Kurds. Saddam had personally executed a number of his own generals whom he felt were disloyal.
`executed` 处决
`disloyal` 不忠的

Although I was positive Saddam would no longer be a threat to the other men in the room, the Iraqi leaders were not so certain. The fear in their eyes was unmistakable. This man, the Butcher of Baghdad, had for decades terrorized an entire nation. His cult of personality had drawn to him followers of the worst sort. His murderous thugs had brutalized the innocent and forced thousands to flee the country. No one in Iraq had mustered the courage to challenge the tyrant. There was no doubt in my mind that these new leaders were still terrified of what Saddam might be able to do—even from behind bars.
`unmistakable` 毋庸置疑的
`drawn` 美 [drɔn] adj. 拔出的 v. 画，绘图
`murderous` 英 ['mɜːd(ə)rəs]  美 ['mɝdərəs] adj. 杀人的，残忍的；凶残的；蓄意谋杀的

`flee` 美 [fli] vi. 逃走；消失，消散 vt. 逃跑，逃走；逃避
`muster` 美 ['mʌstɚ]vt. 召集；对…进行点名；使振作 n. 集合；检阅；点名册；集合人员 vi. 召集；聚集

If the purpose of the meeting was to show Saddam that he was no longer in power—it had failed. In those brief moments, Saddam had managed to intimidate and frighten the new regime leadership. He seemed more confident than ever.
`intimidate` 美 [ɪn'tɪmɪdet] vt. 恐吓，威胁；胁迫
`frighten` 美 ['fraɪtn] vt. 使惊吓；吓唬… vi. 害怕，惊恐
As the Iraqi leaders left, I instructed my guards to isolate the former president in a small room. There would be no visitors, and the guards in the room were ordered not to talk with Saddam.

Over the next month, I visited the small room every day. And every day Saddam rose to greet me(而每天萨达姆都会起来迎接我), and every day without speaking, I motioned him back to his cot. The message was clear. He was no longer important. He could no longer intimidate those around him. He could no longer instill fear into his subjects. Gone was the gleaming palace. Gone were the handmaidens, the servants, and the generals. Gone was the power. The arrogance and oppressiveness that had defined his rule had ended. Courageous young American soldiers had stood up to his tyranny, and now he was no longer a threat to anyone.
`instill` 英/美 [ɪn'stɪl] vt. 徐徐滴入；逐渐灌输
`subjects` 臣民
`palace` 美 [ˈpælɪs] n. 宫殿；宅邸；豪华住宅

`tyranny` 美 ['tɪrəni] n. 暴政；专横；严酷；残暴的行为
`courageous` 美 [kə'redʒəs] adj. 有胆量的，勇敢的

Thirty days later, I transferred Saddam Hussein to a proper military police unit, and a year later the Iraqis hanged him for his crimes against the nation.
`proper` 美 ['prɑpɚ] adj. 适当的；本身的；特有的；正派的 adv. 完全地
`而一年后，伊拉克人因他对国家犯下的罪行而将他绞死。`

Bullies are all the same; whether they are in the school yard, in the workplace, or ruling a country through terror. They thrive on fear and intimidation. Bullies gain their strength through the timid and faint of heart. They are like sharks that sense fear in the water. They will circle to see if their prey is struggling. They will probe to see if their victim is weak. If you don’t find the courage to stand your ground, they will strike. In life, to achieve your goals, to complete the night swim, you will have to be men and women of great courage. That courage is within all of us. Dig deep, and you will find it in abundance.

`dig` 挖掘
`abundance` 美 [ə'bʌndəns] n. 充裕，丰富
`timid` 美 ['tɪmɪd] adj. 胆小的；羞怯的

BS:这种勇气存在于我们所有人之中。深入挖掘，你会发现它的大量存在。

## chapter 8 Rise to the Occasion
If you want to change the world… be your very best in the darkest moments.

I stood on the small sandy spit of land, looking across the bay at the line of warships that were moored at 32nd Street Naval Base. In between the ships and our starting point was a small vessel anchored in San Diego Bay that would be this evening’s “target.” Our training class had spent the last several months learning to dive the basic SCUBA and the more advanced, bubbleless, Emerson closed-circuit diving rig. Tonight was the culmination of Dive Phase, the most technically difficult part of basic SEAL training.

Our objective was to swim the two thousand meters underwater from the starting point across the bay to the anchored vessel. Once underneath the ship, we were to place our practice limpet mine on the keel and then, without being detected, return to the beach. The Emerson diving apparatus was morbidly referred to as the “death rig.” It was known to malfunction occasionally, and according to SEAL folklore a number of trainees had died over the years using the Emerson.

At night the visibility in San Diego Bay was so bad that you couldn’t see your hand in front of your face. All you had was a small green chemical light to illuminate your underwater compass. To make matters worse the fog was rolling in. The haze hung low over the bay, making it difficult to take an initial compass bearing on our target. If you missed the target you would find yourself in the shipping channel, never a good place to be when a Navy destroyer was pulling into port.

The SEAL instructors paced back and forth in front of the twenty-five pairs of divers preparing for the night’s dive. The instructors seemed as nervous as we were. They knew that this training event had the highest potential for someone to get hurt or die.
`forth` 美 [fɔrθ] adv. 向前，向外；自…以后

The chief petty officer in charge of the event summoned all the divers into a small circle. “Gentlemen,” he said. “Tonight we find out which of you sailors really want to be frogmen.” He paused for effect. “It’s cold and dark out there. It will be darker under the ship. So dark that you can get disoriented. So dark that if you get separated from your swim buddy, he will not be able to find you.” The fog was now closing in around us and the mist encircled even the spit of land on which we stood. “Tonight, you will have to be your very best. You must rise above your fears, your doubts, and your fatigue. No matter how dark it gets, you must complete the mission. This is what separates you from everyone else. Somehow those words stayed with me for the next thirty years.

As I watched the fog encircle the airfield at Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, another dark moment was unfolding in front of me. A massive C-17 aircraft was parked on the tarmac, its ramp lowered, standing by to receive the remains of a fallen warrior.

This was a Ramp Ceremony. It was one of the most solemn and yet unquestionably inspiring aspects of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was America at its finest. Every man, every woman, regardless of their background, regardless of how heroic their final moments, was treated with incredible dignity and honor. It was our nation’s way of recognizing their sacrifice. It was our last salute, our final thanks, and a prayer to send them on their way home.

都被赋予了令人难以置信的尊严和荣誉。这是我们国家对他们的牺牲的认可方式。这是我们最后的敬意，
我们最后的感谢，以及送他们回家的祈祷。
```
Extending out from the ramp were two parallel lines of soldiers. Standing at parade rest, they formed the honor guard. Off to the right of the airplane was a small three-piece band softly playing "Amazing Grace"

A few others, myself included, were gathered to the left, and all along hangar row stood hundreds of other soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, civilians, and our allies. They had all come to pay their last respects.
`hangar`美 ['hæŋɚ] n. 飞机库；飞机棚

The HUMVEE tactical vehicle carrying the remains arrived right on time. Six men from the fallen heroes unit acted as pallbearers. Off-loading the flag-draped casket, they slowly marched through the honor guard, up the ramp, and onto the plane.

As “Taps” was played, tears rolled down the soldiers’ faces. There was no attempt to hide their pain.

As the pallbearers departed, those lined up outside came through one by one, saluting, and kneeling by the casket for one last thought.
`kneeling` 英/美 [ni:l] n. 跪着，跪下 v. 跪着（kneel的ing形式）；跪下

The night wind coming off the ocean was gusting to twenty miles an hour. There was no moon out, and an evening layer of low clouds obscured the stars. I was sitting in chest-deep mud, covered from head to toe with a layer of grime. My vision blurred by the caked-on clay, I could see only the outline of my fellow students lined up in the pit beside me.
```

It was Wednesday of Hell Week, and my SEAL training class was down at the infamous Tijuana mudflats. Hell Week was the seminal event for the First Phase of SEAL training. It was six days of no sleep and unrelenting harassment by the instructors. There were long runs, open ocean swims, obstacle courses, rope climbs, endless sessions of calisthenics, and constant paddling of the inflatable boat small (IBS). The purpose of Hell Week was to eliminate the weak, those not tough enough to be SEALs.
`infamous` 美 ['ɪnfəməs] adj. 声名狼藉的；无耻的；邪恶的；不名誉的

Statistically speaking, more students quit during Hell Week than at any other time in training, and the mudflats were the toughest part of the week. Located between South San Diego and Mexico, the mudflats were a low-lying area（低洼地区） where drainage from San Diego created a large swath of deep, thick mud that had the consistency of wet clay.
`drainage` 美 ['drenɪdʒ] n. 排水；排水系统；污水；排水面积
`swath` 美 [sweð] n. 细长的列；收割的刈痕；收割的宽度
`clay` 美 [kle] n. [土壤] 粘土；泥土；肉体；似黏土的东西 vt. 用黏土处理

Earlier that afternoon, our class had paddled our rubber boats from Coronado down to the mudflats. Soon after arriving we were ordered into the mud and began a series of races and individual competitions designed to keep us cold, wet, and miserable. The mud(泥；诽谤的话) clung(紧握；贴近) to every part of your body. It was so dense that moving through it exhausted you and tested your will to carry on.
`miserable` 美 ['mɪzrəbl] adj. 悲惨的；痛苦的；卑鄙的
`exhausted`

For hours the races continued. By the evening, we could barely move from the bone-chilling coldness and the fatigue. As the sun went down the temperature dropped, the wind picked up, and everything seemed to get even harder.
`fatigue` 美 [fə'tig] n. 疲劳，疲乏；杂役 vt. 使疲劳；使心智衰弱 vi. 疲劳 adj. 疲劳的
`the bone-chilling` 刺骨的

Morale was declining rapidly. It was only Wednesday, and we all knew that another three days of pain and exhaustion lay ahead. This was the moment of truth for a lot of the students. Shaking uncontrollably, with hands and feet swollen from nonstop use and skin so tender that even the slightest movement brought discomfort, our hope for completing the training was fading fast.

Silhouetted against the distant lights of the city, a SEAL instructor walked purposefully to the edge of the mudflats. Sounding like an old friend, he softly talked into a bullhorn and offered comfort to the suffering trainees. We could join him and the other instructors by the fire, he said. He had hot coffee and chicken soup. We could relax until the sun came up. Get off our feet. Take it easy.

I could sense that some of the students were ready to accept his offer. After all, how much longer could we survive in the mud? A warm fire, hot coffee, and chicken soup sure sounded good. **But then came the catch**. All he needed was for five of us to quit. Just five quitters and the rest of the class could have some relief from the pain.

The student beside me started to move toward the instructor. I grabbed his arm and held him tight, but the urge to leave the mud was too great. He broke free of my grasp and began to lunge for dry ground. I could see the instructor smiling. He knew that once one man quit, others would follow.
`grabbed` 英/美 [græbd] v. 攫取；捕获；强夺；匆忙地做

Suddenly, above the howl of the wind came a voice. Singing. It was tired and raspy, but loud enough to be heard by all. The lyrics were not meant for tender ears, but everyone knew the tune. One voice became two and two became three and then before long everyone was singing.

The student rushing for the dry ground turned around and came back beside me. Looping his arm around mine, he began to sing as well. The instructor grabbed the bullhorn and shouted for the class to quit singing. No one did. He yelled at the class leader to get control of the trainees. The singing continued. With each threat from the instructor, the voices got louder, the class got stronger, and the will to continue on in the face of adversity became unbreakable. In the darkness, with the fire reflecting on the face of the instructor, I could see him smile. Once again, we had learned an important lesson: the power of one person to unite the group, the power of one person to inspire those around him, to give them hope. If that one person could sing while neck deep in mud, then so could we. If that one person could endure the freezing cold, then so could we. If that one person could hold on, then so could we.
`endure`


The large room at Dover Air Force Base was filled with grieving families—inconsolable children sobbing in their mothers’ arms, parents holding hands hoping to gain strength from each other, and wives with a far-off look of disbelief. Just five days earlier, a helicopter carrying Navy SEALs and their Afghan Special Operations partners, and flown by Army aviators had been shot down in Afghanistan. All thirty-eight men on board were killed. It was the single greatest loss in the War on Terror.

In less than an hour, a large C-17 transport aircraft was scheduled to land at Dover(多佛), and the families of the fallen heroes would be escorted to the flight line to meet the flag-draped coffins. But as the families waited, the President of the United States, the Secretary of Defense, the service secretaries, and senior military leaders filed into the waiting room to pay their respects and give comfort where they could.

`coffins` 英/美 ['kɔfin] 棺材 断送

I had attended dozens of services for fallen soldiers. It was never easy, and I often wondered whether my words of solace made any difference to those who lost loved ones or whether the shock of their loss made everything I said incomprehensible.
`attended`[əˈtɛndɪd] v. 参加；注意；照料
`solace` 英/美 ['sɒlɪs] n. 安慰；慰藉；安慰之物 vt. 安慰；抚慰；使快乐
`incomprehensible` 美 [ɪn,kɑmprɪ'hɛnsəbl] adj. 费解的；不可思议的；无限的


As my wife, Georgeann, and I began to talk with the families I struggled with the right words. How could I truly empathize with their pain? How could I tell them that the sacrifice of their son, their husband, their father, their brother, their friend, was worth it? I did my best to console each one. I hugged them. I prayed with them. I tried to remain strong for them, but somehow I knew my words fell short.

`console` 美 ['kɑnsol] n. [计] 控制台；[电] 操纵台 vt. 安慰；慰藉

Then, as I knelt down beside an elderly woman, I noticed the family next to me talking with Marine Lieutenant General John Kelly. The military assistant to the Secretary of Defense, Kelly was tall, ww, with close-cropped gray hair and dressed in an immaculate Marine uniform. The family was gathered around him, and I could sense that his words of sympathy and encouragement in the face of this tragedy were having a profound effect on the grief-stricken parents and their children. He smiled and they smiled. He hugged and they hugged back. He reached out his hand and they grasped it tightly.
`knelt` 美 [nɛlt] v. 跪下

After embracing the parents one last time and thanking the family for their sacrifice, Kelly moved on to the next group of heartbroken survivors. During the next hour, John Kelly touched almost every family in the room. More than any other visitor that day Kelly’s words resonated with every parent, every wife, every brother and sister, and every friend. His words were words of understanding. His were words of compassion, and above all, his were words of hope.
`compassion` 美 [kəm'pæʃən] n. 同情；怜悯

Only John Kelly could have made a difference that day. Only John Kelly could have given them hope, because only John Kelly knew what it was like to lose a son in combat.

Marine First Lieutenant Robert Kelly was killed in Afghanistan in 2010 while serving with the Third Battalion, Fifth Marines. General Kelly and his family had struggled with the tragedy, just like the families at Dover that day. But the Kelly family had survived. They had endured through the pain, the heartache, and the inconsolable sense of loss.
`inconsolable` 美 ['ɪnkən'soləbl] adj. 无法安慰的

As I watched him that day he also gave me strength. The truth is, when you lose a soldier you grieve for the families, but you also fear that the same fate may someday befall you. You wonder whether you could survive the loss of a child. Or you wonder how your family would get along without you by their side. You hope and pray that God will be merciful and not have you shoulder this unthinkable burden.
`merciful` 美 ['mɝsɪfl] adj. 仁慈的；慈悲的；宽容的
`unthinkable` 美 [ʌn'θɪŋkəbl] adj. 不能想象的；过分的

Over the course of the next three years, John Kelly and I became close friends. He was a remarkable officer, a strong husband to his wife, Karen, and a loving father to his daughter, Kate, and oldest son, Marine Major John Kelly. But more than that, without ever knowing it, John Kelly gave all those around him hope. Hope that in the very worst of times we could rise above the pain, the disappointment, and the agony and be strong. That we each had within us the ability to carry on and not only to survive but also to inspire others.
`agony`美 ['æɡəni] n. 苦恼；极大的痛苦；临死的挣扎

Hope is the most powerful force in the universe. With hope you can inspire nations to greatness. With hope you can raise up the downtrodden. With hope you can ease the pain of unbearable loss. Sometimes all it takes is one person to make a difference.
`downtrodden` 美 ['daʊntrɑdn] adj. 被践踏的，被蹂躏的；受压迫的

We will all find ourselves neck deep in mud someday. That is the time to sing loudly, to smile broadly, to lift up those around you and give them hope that tomorrow will be a better day.
