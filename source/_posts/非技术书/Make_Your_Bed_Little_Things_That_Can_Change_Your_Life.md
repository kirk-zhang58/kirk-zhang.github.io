## chapter 1 Start Your Day with a Task Completed
The barracks at basic SEAL training is a nondescript three-story building located on the beach at Coronado, California, just one hundred yards from the Pacific Ocean. There is no air-conditioning in the building, and at night, with the windows open, you can hear the tide roll in and the surf pounding against the sand.

Rooms in the barracks are spartan. In the officers’ room, where I berthed with three other classmates, there were four beds, a closet to hang your uniforms, and nothing else. Those mornings that I stayed in the barracks I would roll out of my Navy “rack” and immediately begin the process of making my bed. It was the first task of the day. A day that I knew would be filled with uniform inspections, long swims, longer runs, obstacle courses, and constant harassment from the SEAL instructors.

“Attention!” shouted the class leader, Lieutenant Junior Grade Dan’l Steward, as the instructor entered the room. Standing at the foot of the bed, I snapped my heels together and stood up straight as a chief petty officer approached my position. The instructor, stern and expressionless, began the inspection by checking the starch in my green uniform hat to ensure the eight-sided “cover” was crisp and correctly blocked. Moving from top to bottom, his eyes looked over every inch of my uniform. Were the creases in the blouse and trousers aligned? Was the brass on the belt shined to a mirrorlike radiance? Were my boots polished bright enough so he could see his fingers in their reflection? Satisfied that I met the high standards expected of a SEAL trainee, he moved to inspect the bed.

The bed was as simple as the room, nothing but a steel frame and a single mattress. A bottom sheet covered the mattress, and over that was a top sheet. A gray wool blanket tucked tightly under the mattress provided warmth from the cool San Diego evenings. A second blanket was expertly folded into a rectangle at the foot of the bed. A single pillow, made by the Lighthouse for the Blind, was centered at the top of the bed and intersected at a ninety-degree angle with the blanket at the bottom. This was the standard. Any deviation from this exacting requirement would be cause for me to “hit the surf” and then roll around on the beach until I was covered head to toe with wet sand—referred to as a “sugar cookie.”

Standing motionless, I could see the instructor out of the corner of my eye. He wearily looked at my bed. Bending over, he checked the hospital corners and then surveyed the blanket and the pillow to ensure they were correctly aligned. Then, reaching into his pocket, he pulled out a quarter and flipped it into the air several times to ensure I knew the final test of the bed was coming. With one final flip the quarter flew high into the air and came down on the mattress with a light bounce. It jumped several inches off the bed, high enough for the instructor to catch it in his hand.

Swinging around to face me, the instructor looked me in the eye and nodded. He never said a word. Making my bed correctly was not going to be an opportunity for praise. It was expected of me. It was my first task of the day, and doing it right was important. It demonstrated my discipline. It showed my attention to detail, and at the end of the day it would be a reminder that I had done something well, something to be proud of, no matter how small the task.

Throughout my life in the Navy, making my bed was the one constant that I could count on every day. As a young SEAL ensign aboard the USS Grayback, a special operation submarine, I was berthed in sick bay, where the beds were stacked four high. The salty old doctor who ran sick bay insisted that I make my rack every morning. He often remarked that if the beds were not made and the room was not clean, how could the sailors expect the best medical care? As I later found out, this sentiment of cleanliness and order applied to every aspect of military life.

Thirty years later, the Twin Towers came down in New York City. The Pentagon was struck, and brave Americans died in an airplane over Pennsylvania.

At the time of the attacks, I was recuperating in my home from a serious parachute accident. A hospital bed had been wheeled into my government quarters, and I spent most of the day lying on my back, trying to recover. I wanted out of that bed more than anything else. Like every SEAL I longed to be with my fellow warriors in the fight.

When I was finally well enough to lift myself unaided from the bed, the first thing I did was pull the sheets up tight, adjust the pillow, and make sure the hospital bed looked presentable to all those who entered my home. It was my way of showing that I had conquered the injury and was moving forward with my life.

Within four weeks of 9/11, I was transferred to the White House, where I spent the next two years in the newly formed Office of Combatting Terrorism. By October 2003, I was in Iraq at our makeshift headquarters on the Baghdad airfield. For the first few months we slept on Army cots. Nevertheless, I would wake every morning, roll up my sleeping bag, place the pillow at the head of the cot, and get ready for the day.

In December 2003, U.S. forces captured Saddam Hussein. He was held in confinement during which time we kept him in a small room. He also slept on an Army cot, but with the luxury of sheets and a blanket. Once a day I would visit Saddam to ensure my soldiers were properly caring for him. I noticed, with some sense of amusement, that Saddam did not make his bed. The covers were always crumpled at the foot of his cot and he rarely seemed inclined to straighten them.

During the ensuing ten years, I had the honor of working with some of the finest men and women this nation has ever produced—from generals to privates, from admirals to seamen recruits, from ambassadors to clerk typists. The Americans who deployed overseas in support of the war effort came willingly, sacrificing much to protect this great nation.

They all understood that life is hard and that sometimes there is little you can do to affect the outcome of your day. In battle soldiers die, families grieve, your days are long and filled with anxious moments. You search for something that can give you solace, that can motivate you to begin your day, that can be a sense of pride in an oftentimes ugly world. But it is not just combat. It is daily life that needs this same sense of structure. Nothing can replace the strength and comfort of one’s faith, but sometimes the simple act of making your bed can give you the lift you need to start your day and provide you the satisfaction to end it right.

If you want to change your life and maybe the world—start off by making your bed!

## chapter 2 You Can’t Go It Alone

I learned early on in SEAL training the value of teamwork, the need to rely on someone else to help you through the difficult tasks. For those of us who were “tadpoles” hoping to become Navy frogmen, a ten-foot rubber raft was used to teach us this vital lesson.

`tabpoles` ['tæd,pol] / n.脊椎 蝌蚪 
`rubber` ['rʌbɚ] / n.橡胶；橡皮
`vital` ['vaɪtl] / adj. 至关重要的；生死攸关的；有活力的

Everywhere we went during the first phase of SEAL training we were required to carry the raft. We placed it on our heads as we ran from the barracks, across the highway, to the chow hall. We carried it in a low-slung position as we ran up and down the Coronado sand dunes. We paddled the boat endlessly from north to south along the coastline and through the pounding surf, seven men, all working together to get the rubber boat to its final destination.
`chow hall`   / 食堂
`dunes` [dʊn] / 沙丘
`low-slung` [] / 腰身
`poundding` ['paʊndɪŋ] / n.重击；重击声

But we learned something else on our journey with the raft. Occasionally, one of the boat crew members was sick or injured, unable to give it 100 percent. I often found myself exhausted from the training day, or down with a cold or the flu. On those days, the other members picked up the slack. They paddled harder. They dug deeper. They gave me their rations for extra strength. And when the time came, later in training, I returned the favor. The small rubber boat made us realize that no man could make it through training alone. No SEAL could make it through combat alone and by extension you needed people in your life to help you through the difficult times.
`crew` [krʊ] / n. 队，组；全体人员，全体船员 vi. 一起工作
`slack` [slæk] / adj. 松弛的；疏忽的；不流畅的 vi. 松懈；减弱 n. 煤末；峡谷
`picked up` [] / 捡起 获得
`ration`  / vt. 配给；定量供应 n. 定量；口粮；配给量
`favor`  / 喜爱和赞成

Never was the need for help more apparent to me than twenty-five years later 
when I commanded all the SEALs on the West Coast.
I was the commodore of Naval Special Warfare Group ONE in Coronado. A Navy captain, I had by now spent the past several decades leading SEALs around the world. I was out for a routine parachute jump when things went terribly wrong.
`captian` 上校

We were in a C-130 Hercules aircraft climbing to twelve thousand feet preparing for the jump. Looking out the back of the aircraft, we could see a beautiful California day. Not a cloud in the sky. The Pacific Ocean was calm, and from this altitude you could see the border of Mexico just a few miles away.
`climbing` [] / v 爬
`calm` [] / adj 平静的

The jumpmaster yelled to “stand by.” Now on the edge of the ramp, I could see straight down to the ground. The jumpmaster looked me in the eye, smiled, and shouted, “Go, go, go!” I dove out of the aircraft, arms fully extended and legs tucked slightly behind my back. The prop blast from the aircraft sent me tilting forward until my arms caught air and I leveled out.
`ramp` [ræmp] / n. 斜坡，坡道；敲诈 vi. 蔓延；狂跳乱撞；
`dove` [] / v潜水式
`prop` [prɑp] / n. 支柱，支撑物；支持者；道具；（橄榄球中的）支柱前锋 vt. 支撑，支持，维持；使倚靠在某物上
`blast` [blæst] / n. 爆炸；冲击波；一阵 vi. 猛攻 vt. 爆炸；损害；使枯萎
`tilting` [tɪlt] / n. 倾卸台adj. [航][气象] 倾斜；倾卸
`level` [] / n. 水平；标准；水平面 adj. 水平的；平坦的；同高的 vi. 瞄准；拉平；变得平坦 vt. 使同等；对准；弄平
`altitude`  [] / n高度

I quickly checked my altimeter, made sure I wasn’t spinning, and then looked around me to ensure no jumper was too close to me. Twenty seconds later I had fallen to the pull altitude of 5,500 feet.
`altimeter` [æl'tɪmətɚ] / n 测高仪
`too to` 这东西要多角度看

Suddenly, I looked below me and another jumper had slid beneath me, intersecting my path to the ground. He pulled his rip cord, and I could see the pilot chute deploying the main parachute from his backpack. Immediately, I thrust my arms to my side, forcing my head to the ground in an attempt to get away from the blossoming chute. It was too late.

The jumper’s chute popped open in front of me like an air bag, hitting me at 120 miles an hour. I bounced off the main canopy and spun out of control, barely conscious from the impact. For seconds I spun head over heels (倒转身体), trying to get stable again. I couldn’t see my altimeter and was unaware of how far I had fallen.
`slid` [slɪd] / v 滑
`rip`  [] / vt. 撕；锯 vi. 裂开，被撕裂 n. 裂口，裂缝
`cord` [] / v 绳索
`pilot` [paɪlət] / n.飞行员；领航员
`chute` [ʃut] / 降落伞 
`thrust` [θrʌst] /  n. [力] 推力；刺 vt. 插；插入；推挤
`canopy` ['kænəpi] / n. 天篷；华盖；遮篷；苍穹vt. 用天蓬遮盖；遮盖
`conscious` ['kɑnʃəs] /  adj. 意识到的；故意的；

Instinctively, I reached for my rip cord and pulled. The pilot chute jettisoned from its small pouch in the back of the parachute but wrapped around my leg as I continued to tumble toward the ground. As I struggled to untangle myself the situation got worse. The main parachute partially deployed but in doing so twirled around my other leg.
`instinctively` [in'stiŋktivli] /  adv. 本能地
`jettisoned` ['dʒɛtɪsn] /  n. 投弃；投弃货物 vt. 投弃
`tumble` ['tʌmbl] / vi. 摔倒；倒塌；滚动；打滚；仓惶地行动 vt. 使摔倒；使滚翻；弄乱 n. 跌倒；翻筋斗；跌跤
`untangle` [ʌn'tæŋɡl] / vt. 清理；整顿；解开…纠结
`twirled` [twɜːrl] / v.（使）旋转，转动；使轻快地转动；（用手指）缠绕，捻弄 n.转动，旋转（一周）；螺旋形曲线；旋转的东西

Craning my neck toward the sky, I could see my legs were bound by two sets of risers, the long nylon straps that connect the main parachute to the harness on my back. One riser had wrapped around one leg, the other riser around the other leg. The main parachute was fully out of the backpack but hung up somewhere on my body.
`crane` [kren] /n. 吊车，起重机；鹤 vi. 伸着脖子看；迟疑，踌躇 vt. 用起重机起吊；伸长脖子

As I struggled to break free of the entanglement, suddenly I felt the canopy lift off my body and begin to open. Looking toward my legs, I knew what was coming next.
`entanglement` [ɪn'tæŋɡlmənt] / n. 纠缠；铁丝网；缠绕物；牵连

Within seconds, the canopy caught air. The two risers, one wrapped around each leg, suddenly and violently pulled apart, taking my legs with them. My pelvis separated instantly as the force of the opening ripped my lower torso. The thousand small muscles that connect the pelvis to the body were torn from their hinges.
`violently` ['vaɪələntli] / adv. 猛烈地，激烈地
`apart` [ə'pɑrt] / adv. 相距；与众不同地；分离着 adj. 分离的；与众不同的
`torso` ['tɔrso] / n. 躯干；裸体躯干雕像
`hinges` / . [机] 铰链；合页（hinge的复数）；小五金 v. 给…装上绞链；使以…为条件
`torn` [] / v. 扯裂，撕开

My mouth dropped open and I let out a scream that could be heard in Mexico. Searing pain arched through my body, sending waves pulsating downward to my pelvis and upward to my head. Violent, muscular convulsions racked my upper torso, shooting more pain through my arms and legs. Now, like having an out-of-body experience, I became aware of my screaming and tried to control it, but the pain was too intense.
`searing` ['sɪrɪŋ] / adj. 灼热的 v. 使枯萎（sear的ing形式）
`arched` [ɑrtʃt] / adj. 拱形的；有拱的；弓形结构的 v. 成弓形弯曲；成弓形
`pelvis` [ˈpelvɪs] /  n.骨盆
`muscular` ['mʌskjəlɚ] / adj. 肌肉的；肌肉发达的；强健的
`convulsion` [kənˈvʌlʃnz] / n. [内科]抽搐；社会动乱；哄堂大笑；震动
`rack` [ræk] / n. [机] 齿条；架子；拷问台 vi. 变形；随风飘；小步跑 vt. 折磨；榨取
`intense` [ɪn'tɛns] / adj. 强烈的；紧张的；非常的；热情的

Still head down and falling too fast, I turned myself upright in the harness, relieving some of the pressure on my pelvis and back.

I had fallen over four thousand feet before the parachute deployed. The good news: I had a full canopy over my head. The bad news: I was broken apart by the impact of the opening.
`relieve` vt. 解除，减轻；使不单调乏味
`apart by` 分开 by

 landed over two miles from the drop zone. Within a few minutes the drop zone crew and an ambulance arrived. I was taken to the trauma hospital in downtown San Diego. By the next day I was out of surgery. The accident had ripped my pelvis apart by almost five inches. The muscles in my stomach had become detached from the pelvic bone and the muscles in my back and legs were severely damaged from the opening shock. I had a large titanium plate screwed into my pelvis and a long scapular screw drilled into my backside for stability.
 `downtown` ['daʊn'taʊn] / adv. 往闹市区；在市区 adj. 市中心的
 `surgery` ['sɝdʒəri] / n. 外科；外科手术；手术室；诊疗室
 `detached` [dɪ'tætʃt] / adj. 分离的，分开的；超然的 v.分离
 `titanium`  [taɪ'tenɪəm;] / 钛
 `screwed`   vt. 旋，拧；压榨；强迫 n. 螺旋；螺丝钉；吝啬鬼
 `scapular` [ˈskæpjələr] /  n. 肩胛；修道士的肩衣；肩羽
 `drill` [drɪl] / adj. 钻过孔的 v. 钻孔

 This seemed like the end of my career. To be an effective SEAL you had to be physically fit. My rehabilitation was going to take months, maybe years, and the Navy was required to conduct a medical evaluation to determine if I was fit for duty. I left the hospital seven days later but remained bedridden at my home for the next two months.
 `evaluation` [ɪ,væljʊ'eʃən] / n. 评价；[审计] 评估
 `bedridden` ['bɛdrɪdn] / adj. 卧床不起的
 `rehabilitation` [riːəˌbɪlɪ'teʃn] / n. 复原

 All my life I had the feeling I was invincible. I believed that my innate athletic abilities could get me out of most perilous situations. And, up to this point, I had been right. Many times during my career I had encountered life-threatening incidents: midair collisions in another parachute; uncontrolled descent in a minisub; nearly falling hundreds of feet off an oil rig; getting trapped beneath a sinking boat; demolition that exploded prematurely(过早爆炸的拆卸工程); and countless more—incidents where a split second(每一秒) decided the fate between living and dying. Each time I had somehow managed to make the right decision, and each time I was physically fit enough to overcome the challenge before me. Not this time.
`invincible` [ɪn'vɪnsəbl] / adj. 无敌的；不能征服的
`innate` [ɪ'net] / adj. 先天的；固有的；与生俱来的
`athletic` [æθ'lɛtɪk] / adj. 运动的，运动员的；体格健壮的
`perilous ` ['pɛrələs] / adj. 危险的，冒险的
`midair collisions` [kə'lɪʒən]  / n. [物] 碰撞；冲突；撞击
`descent`  [dɪ'sɛnt] / n. 下降；血统；袭击 vt. 除去…的气味；使…失去香味
`minisub` [] / 小型潜水艇
`oil rig`  石油钻塔
`trap` [træpt] / adj. 捕获的；陷入困境的；收集的；受到限制的vt. 诱捕

Now, lying in bed, all I felt was self-pity. But that would not last for long. My wife, Georgeann, had been given nursing duties. She cleaned my wounds, gave me the required daily shots, and changed my bedpan. But most importantly, she reminded me of who I was. I had never given up on anything in my life and she assured me that I was not going to start now. She refused to let me feel sorry for myself. It was the kind of tough love that I needed, and as the days went by, I got better.
`self-pity` [] / n. 自怜；自哀
`bedpan` [ˈbedpæn] /  n. 便盆；睡床用脚炉
`assure` [ə'ʃʊrd] / adj. 确定的；自信的
`tough` [tʌf] / adj. 艰苦的，困难的；坚强的，不屈不挠的；坚韧的，牢固的；强壮的，结实的n. 恶棍 vt. 坚持；忍受，忍耐

My friends came by the house, called constantly, and helped with whatever they could. My boss, Admiral Eric Olson somehow found a way around the policy that required the Navy to conduct a medical evaluation of my ability to continue to serve as a SEAL. His support for me likely saved my career.

During my time in the SEAL Teams I had numerous setbacks, and in each case, someone came forward to help me: someone who had faith in my abilities; someone who saw potential in me where others might not; someone who risked their own reputation to advance my career. I have never forgotten those people and I know that anything I achieved in my life was a result of others who have helped me along the way.
`setbacks` ['sɛt,bæk] / n. 挫折；周折（setback复数）
`reputation` [reputation] / n. 名声，名誉；声望

None of us are immune from life’s tragic moments. Like the small rubber boat we had in basic SEAL training, it takes a team of good people to get you to your destination in life. You cannot paddle the boat alone. Find someone to share your life with. Make as many friends as possible, and never forget that your success depends on others.
`immune` [] / adj. 免疫的
`tragic` ['trædʒɪk] / adj. 悲剧的；悲痛的，不幸的

## chapter 3 Only the Size of Your Heart Matters

I ran to the beach with my black, rubber flippers tucked underneath my right arm and my mask in my left hand. Coming to parade rest, I anchored the flippers in the soft sand, leaning them against each other to form a teepee. Standing to my right and left were other students. Dressed in green tee shirts, khaki swim trunks, neoprene booties, and a small life jacket, we were preparing for our morning two-mile swim.
`flippers` ['flipə] / 脚蹼
`parade` [pə'red] / n.阅兵场
`anchored` ['æŋkɚ] / adj. 固定的；抛锚的 v. 固定；抛锚；主持
`teepee` ['tipi] /n. （美）圆锥形帐篷

`neoprene` ['niəprin] / n. [橡胶] 氯丁橡胶
`life jacket` / 救生衣

The life jacket was a small, rubberized bladder that inflated only when you pulled the handle. Among the students, it was considered shameful if you had to use your life jacket. Still, the SEAL instructors were required to inspect every life jacket before each swim. This inspection also gave the instructors an opportunity for more harassment.
`inspect` [ɪn'spɛkt] /  vt. 检查；视察；检阅
`harassment` [hə'ræsmənt] / n. 骚扰；烦恼
`rubberized` ['rʌbəraɪzd] / adj. 涂上胶的；橡胶处理的
`bladder` ['blædɚ] / n. 膀胱；囊状物，可充气的囊袋

The surf off Coronado that day was about eight feet high. The waves were coming in lines of three, plunging with a roaring sound that made each student’s heart beat a bit faster. As the instructor slowly moved down the line he came to the man directly to my right. The student, a seaman recruit and brand-new to the Navy, was about five foot four in height. The SEAL instructor, a highly decorated Vietnam vet, was well above six foot two and towered over the smaller man.
`decorated` ['dekəreɪtɪd] / adj. 装饰的，修饰的
`roaring` 美 ['rɔrɪŋ] / adj. 喧闹的；兴胜的；狂风暴雨的 n. 咆哮；怒吼；吼声

After inspecting the student’s life jacket, the instructor looked over his left shoulder toward the pounding surf and then reached down and grabbed the student’s flippers. Holding them close to the young sailor’s face, he said quietly, “Do you really want to be a frogman?”
`look over` 检查，察看；从……上面看；原谅
`pounding`  汹涌澎湃的

The sailor stood up straight, with a look of defiance in his eyes. “Yes, instructor, I do!” he shouted.
“You’re a tiny little man,” the instructor said, waving the flippers in his face. “Those waves out there could break you in half.” He paused and glanced toward the ocean. “You should think about quitting now before you get hurt.”
`defiance` [dɪ'faɪəns] / n. 蔑视；挑战；反抗

Even out of the corner of my eye I could see the student’s jaw begin to tighten.
“I won’t quit!” the sailor replied, drawing out each word. Then the instructor leaned in and whispered something in the student’s ear. I couldn’t make out the words over the breaking waves.
`jaw` [dʒɔ] / n. 颌；下巴；狭窄入口；唠叨
`tighten` ['taɪtn] / vt. 变紧；使变紧
`drawin out` 拉出

After all the trainees were inspected the instructors ordered us into the water, and we began our swim. An hour later, I crawled out of the surf zone, and standing on the beach was the young seaman recruit. He had finished the swim near the head of the class. Later that day, I pulled him aside and asked what the instructor had whispered to him. He smiled and said proudly, “Prove me wrong!”
`near` [nɪr] / adv.距离不远，在附近；不久，很快；差不多，几乎 prep.在......附近，靠近；接近（某时间、某事件）；（用于数字前）接近；

SEAL training was always about proving something. Proving that size didn’t matter. Proving that the color of your skin wasn’t important. Proving that money didn’t make you better. Proving that determination and grit were always more important than talent. I was fortunate to learn that lesson a year before training began.
`grit` [ɡrɪt] / n.粗砂，砂砾砂砾，粗砂石；勇气；决心 vt. 研磨；在…上铺砂砾，覆以砂砾；咬紧牙关

As I boarded the city bus in downtown San Diego I was excited about the prospect of visiting the basic SEAL training facility across the bay in Coronado. I was a first-class midshipman attending my summer cruise as part of the Naval Reserve Officers Training Corp (ROTC) program. As a first-class midshipman I was between my junior and senior years in college, and if all went well, I hoped to be commissioned the following summer and head off to SEAL training. It was the middle of the week and I had received permission from my ROTC instructor to deviate from the planned training aboard one of the ships in port and make my way to Coronado.
`prospect` ['prɑspɛkt] / n. 前途；预期；景色
`cruise` [krʊz] vi. 巡航，巡游；漫游
`midshipman` n.海军学生
`reserve` [rɪ'zɝv] n. 储备，储存；自然保护区；
`commissioned` adj. 受委任的，受任命的；服役的，现役的
`deviate` ['divɪet] v.偏离
`port` 港口

I got off the bus outside the famed Hotel del Coronado and walked about a mile down the road to the beach side of the Naval Amphibious Base. I passed by several Korean War–vintage buildings that housed Underwater Demolition Teams Eleven and Twelve. Outside the one-story rambling brick building was a large wooden sign depicting Freddy the Frog, a large green web-footed amphibian carrying a stick of TNT and smoking a cigar. This was the home of the West Coast frogmen, those intrepid mask-and-fin warriors whose military ancestors had cleared the beaches of Iwo Jima, Tarawa, Guam, and Inchon. My heart began to beat a little faster. This was exactly where I wanted to be in a year.
`famed` 著名的
`Amphibious` [æm'fɪbɪəs] adj. [生物] 两栖的，水陆两用的；具有双重性的
`Demolition ` [dimə'lɪʃən] n. 拆除（等于demolishment）；破坏；毁坏

`ancestor` ['ænsɛstɚ] n. [生物] 祖先，上代；先祖
`intrepid`mask-and-fin warriors [ɪn'trɛpɪd] adj. 无畏的；勇敢的；勇猛的

As I passed the Underwater Demolition Teams the next building belonged to SEAL Team One, at the time a new breed of jungle fighters who had earned their reputation in Vietnam as some of the toughest men in the military. Another large wooden sign showed Sammy the Seal, a dagger in one hand and a dark cloak wrapped around his shoulders. As I would later learn, the frogmen and the SEALs were one and the same. All the men were graduates of SEAL training, all frogmen at heart.
`breed` [brid] n. [生物] 品种；种类，类型
`dagger` 美 ['dæɡɚ] n. 匕首，短剑
`cloak` 美 [klok] n. 斗蓬；宽大外衣；托词vt. 遮掩；隐匿

Finally, I approached the last government building on the beach side of the naval base. On the outer facade of the building it read, BASIC UNDERWATER DEMOLITION SEAL TRAINING. Standing outside the main entrance were two SEAL instructors surrounded by some young high school sea cadets. The two SEALs towered over the high school students. Senior Chief Petty Officer Dick Ray stood six foot three with broad shoulders, a thin waist, a deep tan, and a dark pencil-thin mustache. He was everything I expected a SEAL to look like. Standing next to him was Chief Petty Officer Gene Wence. Well over six feet, Wence was built like a linebacker, with imposing biceps and a steely-eyed glare that cautioned everyone not to get too close.

`caution`  美 ['kɔʃən] n. 小心，谨慎；警告，警示 v.警告

The sea cadets were ushered into the building. With some trepidation, I followed them and stopped at the front desk. I told the young sailor manning the desk my story. I was a midshipman from the University of Texas and hoped to talk with someone about SEAL training. The sailor left his desk momentarily, returning to inform me that the first phase officer, Lieutenant Doug Huth, would be glad to talk with me in a few minutes.
`usher` 美 ['ʌʃɚ] n. 引座员，带位员；接待员；门房 vt. 引导，招待；迎接；开辟
`trepidation` 美 [ˌtrɛpəˈdeʃən] n. 恐惧；惊恐；忧虑；颤抖
`I told the young sailor manning the desk my story` manning是定语从句修饰那个sailor
`momentarily` 美 [,momən'tɛrəli] adv. 随时地；暂时地；立刻

As I waited to be called into Lieutenant Huth’s office I slowly walked up and down the hall, looking at the pictures that adorned the walls. They were photos of SEALs in Vietnam, guys rising out of the waist-deep mud along the Mekong Delta. Pictures of camouflaged SEAL platoons returning from a night mission. Men loaded with automatic weapons and bandoliers of ammunition (who)boarding a Swift boat heading into the jungle.
`mud` n. 泥；诽谤的话；无价值的东西
`platnoon` 美 [plə'tun] n. 排，团；一组
`bandolier` 美 [ˌbændəˈlɪr] n. 子弹带，弹药带
`camouflaged` ['kæmuflɑ:ʒ] adj. 伪装的 vt. 伪装；
`ammunition` [,æmju'nɪʃən] n. 弹药；军火 vt. 装弹药于

Down the long hall I saw another man looking at the photos. A civilian by his attire, he was slightly built, almost frail, and a mop of dark hair hung Beatle-like over his ears. He seemed to be staring in awe at the incredible warriors whose actions were portrayed in the photos. In my mind, I wondered if he thought he had what it took to be a Navy SEAL. Looking at those pictures, did he really think he was tough enough to endure the training? Did he think his small frame could carry a heavy rucksack and a thousand rounds of ammunition? Hadn’t he seen the two SEAL instructors who were just at the front door? Massive men who clearly had the right stuff? I felt a pang of sorrow that someone had misled this fellow, maybe encouraged him to leave his comfortable life as a civilian and try SEAL training.
`attire` /美 [ə'taɪə] n. 服装；盛装
`frail`  美 [frel] adj. 脆弱的；虚弱的
`a mop of dark hair`  短头发

`portray` 美 [pɔr'tre] vt. 描绘；扮演
`sorrow`  美 [sɑro] n. 悲伤；懊悔；伤心事

A few minutes later, the sailor from the front desk calmly walked down the corridor and escorted me to Lieutenant Huth’s office. Doug Huth was also a recruiting poster for the SEALs; tall, muscular, with brown, wavy hair, he looked very sharp in his Navy khaki uniform.
`wavy` 美 ['wevi] adj. 多浪的；波动起伏的
`look very sharp` 非常醒目

I sat in a chair across from Huth’s desk, and we talked about SEAL training and the demands of the program. Huth told me about his experience in Vietnam and what life would be like in the Teams if I graduated from SEAL training. Out of the corner of my eye, I could see the thin man in civilian clothes as he continued to gaze at the photos on the wall. Like me, he must have been waiting to see Lieutenant Huth in hopes of learning more about SEAL training. It made me feel good about myself knowing that I was clearly stronger and more prepared than another man who thought he could survive the rigors of being a SEAL.
`gaze` 美 [ɡeɪz] vi. 凝视；注视
`in hopes of` - `in favor of`
`rigor` 美 ['rɪgɚ] n. 严厉；精确；苛刻；僵硬

In the middle of our conversation, Lieutenant Huth suddenly stopped talking, looked up from his desk, and yelled to the man in the hall. I stood up as Huth motioned the thin man to come into his office.
“Bill, this is Tommy Norris,” he said, giving the thin man a big bear hug. “Tommy was the last SEAL Medal of Honor recipient from Vietnam,” Huth added. Norris smiled, somewhat embarrassed by the introduction. I smiled back, shook his hand, and laughed at myself. This seemingly frail, mop-haired man who I doubted could make it through training was Lieutenant Tom Norris. Tom Norris, who had served in Vietnam, had on successive nights gone deep behind enemy lines to rescue two downed airmen. This was Tom Norris who, on another mission, was shot in the face by North Vietnamese forces and left for dead only to be rescued by Petty Officer Mike Thornton, who would later receive the Medal of Honor for those actions. This was Tom Norris, who battled back from his injury to be accepted into the FBI’s first Hostage Rescue Team. This quiet, reserved, humble man was one of the toughest SEALs in the long history of the Teams.
`recipient` [rɪ'sɪpɪənt] n. 容器，接受者；容纳者
`somewhat` 美 ['sʌmwʌt] n. 几分；某物
`toughest` 美 [tʌf] adj. 最坚强的；最坚韧的
`reserved`  美 [rɪ'zɝvd] adj. 保留的，预订的；

In 1969, Tommy Norris was almost booted out of SEAL training. They said he was too small, too thin, and not strong enough. But much like the young sailor in my class, Norris proved them all wrong and once again showed that it’s not the size of your flippers that count, just the size of your heart.

## chapter 4 drive on!

get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward.
`get over` 克服；恢复；熬过；原谅

I ran to the top of the sand dune and without hesitation sprinted down the other side, heading full speed toward the Pacific Ocean. Fully clothed in my green utilities, short-billed hat, and combat boots, I dove headfirst into the waves as they pounded the beach off Coronado, California.

`sprint` 美 [sprɪnt] vi. 冲刺，全速跑
`utilities` 美 [ju'tɪlətiz] n. 公用事业；实用工具，[计] 实用程序 (这里应该是指战斗服)
`short-bill hat` 鸭舌帽
`dove` n.鸽子；鸽派人 v.跳水；潜水

Emerging soaking wet from the water, I saw the SEAL instructor standing on the dune. With his arms folded and a piercing glare that cut through the morning haze, I heard him yell, “You know what to do, Mr. Mac!”
Indeed I did.
With feigned enthusiasm, I screamed a hearty “hooyah” at the top of my lungs and fell facedown into the soft sand, rolling from side to side to ensure that no part of my uniform was left uncovered. Then, for good measure, I sat up, reached deep into the ground, and tossed sand into the air to guarantee it found its way into every crevice in my body.
`emerging` 英/美 [ɪ'mɝdʒɪŋ] adj. 新兴的；出现的；形成的v. 形成；浮现；显露（emerge的ing形式）；由…中脱出
`soaking`  ['sokɪŋ] n. 浸湿，浸透

`toss`  美 [tɔs] n. 投掷；摇荡；vt. 投掷

Somewhere during the morning’s physical training I had “committed a violation of the SEAL training rules.” My punishment was to jump into the surf zone, roll around in the sand, and make myself a “sugar cookie.”
`somewhere` 在某处
`violation` [,vaɪə'leʃən] n. 违反；妨碍

In all of SEAL training there was nothing more uncomfortable than being a sugar cookie. There were a lot of things more painful and more exhausting, but being a sugar cookie tested your patience and your determination. Not just because you spent the rest of the day with sand down your neck, under your arms, and between your legs, but because the act of becoming a sugar cookie was completely indiscriminate. There was no rhyme or reason. You became a sugar cookie at the whim of the instructor.
`neck` n.脖子 v.变窄 
`indiscriminate` [ɪndɪ'skrɪmɪnət] adj. 任意的；无差别的；
`rhyme` [raɪm] n. 韵律；韵脚 v 使押韵
`whim`  美 [wɪm]n. 奇想；一时的兴致；怪念头；幻想

To many of the SEAL trainees this was hard to accept. Those that strived to be the very best expected that they would be rewarded for their stellar performance. Sometimes they were and, then again, sometimes they were not. Sometimes the only thing they got for all their effort was wet and sandy.
`reward`  美 [rɪ'wɔrd] n. [劳经] 报酬；报答；酬谢
`stellar` [ˈstelər] adj. 星的；星球的；主要的；一流的
`strived`  [straɪv] v. 努力，力争；斗争，反抗

Feeling like I was sufficiently coated with sand, I ran to the instructor, yelled “hooyah” again, and came to attention. Looking me over to see if I met his standard of excellence in sugar cookies was Lieutenant Phillip L. Martin, known to his friends as Moki. I, however, was not on a first-name basis with Lieutenant Martin.
`basis`['besɪs] n. 基础；底部；主要成分
`first-name` ['fə:stneim] adj. 熟悉的；直呼其名的

Moki Martin was the quintessential frogman. Born and raised in Hawaii, he was everything I strived to be as a SEAL officer. An experienced Vietnam veteran, he was expert with every weapon in the SEAL inventory. He was one of the finest skydivers in the Teams, and being a native Hawaiian, he was so skilled in the water that there were few, if any, who could match him.
`quintessential` [,kwɪntɪ'sɛnʃəl] adj. 精髓的，精萃的
`veteran` ['vɛtərən] n. 老兵；老手；富有经验的人；老运动员 adj. 经验丰富的

“Mr. Mac, do you have any idea why you are a sugar cookie this morning?” Martin said in a very calm but questioning manner.

“No, Instructor Martin,” I dutifully responded.
`dutifully` ['du:tɪfəli] adv. 忠实地；忠贞地
“Because, Mr. Mac, life isn’t fair and the sooner you learn that the better off you will be.”
因为，麦克先生，生活是不公平的，你越早知道，你就会越好

A year later, Lieutenant Martin and I were on a first-name basis. I had completed basic SEAL training, and he had been reassigned from the training center to Underwater Demolition Team Eleven in Coronado.

The more I got to know Moki, the deeper my respect grew for him. In addition to being a superb SEAL operator, Moki was also a phenomenal athlete. In the early 1980s, he was on the leading edge of the triathlon craze. He had a beautiful freestyle stroke in the open ocean. His calves and thighs were strong and moved him effortlessly on the long runs, but his real advantage was the bicycle. He and the bike were made for each other.
`phenomenal` [fɪ'nɒmɪn(ə)l] adj. 现象的；显著的；异常的
`triathlon craze` 铁人三项
`freestyle stroke` 自由泳
`calves` [kævz] n. 小牛；小腿
`thigh`  美 [θaɪ] n. 大腿，股

Every morning he would mount the bike and go for a thirty-mile ride up and down the Coronado Silver Strand. There was a flat stretch of paved bike path that paralleled the Pacific Ocean. It ran from the city of Coronado to the city of Imperial Beach. With the ocean on one side and the bay on the other, it was one of the most beautiful sections of beach in California.
`flat` 平的
`paved` [peiv] 铺砌面

Early one Saturday morning, Moki was out on a training ride along the Silver Strand. Head down, pedaling fast, he never saw the oncoming bicycle. At roughly twenty-five miles an hour the two bikes collided head-on. The bikes crumpled from the impact, slamming the riders together, leaving both men facedown on the asphalt path. The first rider rolled over, dusted himself off, and struggled to his feet. He was banged up but otherwise fine.
`collided`[kə'laid] v. 碰撞，冲突
`crumpled` ['krʌmpld] adj. 摺皱的，弄皱的
`slamming`['slæmiŋ]  n. 砰击
`banged up` 伤痕累累 

Moki remained facedown, unable to move. The paramedics arrived within minutes, stabilized Moki, and transported him to the hospital. Initially there was hope that the paralysis was temporary, but as the days, months, and years passed, Moki never regained the use of his legs. The crash left him paralyzed from the waist down with limited movement in his arms.
`paralyzed` 英/美 ['pærəlaizd] adj. 瘫痪的；麻痹的 v. 使麻痹；使无力
`regained` [rɪ'ɡen] vt. 恢复；重新获得

For the past thirty-five years, Moki has been in a wheelchair. In all those years I never once heard him complain about his misfortune in life. Never once did I hear him ask, “Why me?” Never once did he display an ounce of pity for himself.
`pity`  美 ['pɪti] n. 怜悯，同情；遗憾 vt. 对……表示怜悯

In fact, after his accident, Moki went on to be an accomplished painter. He fathered a beautiful young girl. He founded and continues to oversee the Super Frog Triathlon that is held every year in Coronado.
`father` v
`oversee` 监督
`Triathlon` 三项全能运动
It is easy to blame your lot in life on some outside force, to stop trying because you believe fate is against you. It is easy to think that where you were raised, how your parents treated you, or what school you went to is all that determines your future. Nothing could be further from the truth. The common people and the great men and women are all defined by how they deal with life’s unfairness: Helen Keller, Nelson Mandela, Stephen Hawking, Malala Yousafzai, and—Moki Martin.
很容易认为，你在哪里长大
Sometimes no matter how hard you try, no matter how good you are, you still end up as a sugar cookie. Don’t complain. Don’t blame it on your misfortune. Stand tall, look to the future, and drive on!
